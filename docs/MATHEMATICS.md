## C-Textbook: Documentation-Register Contract

This section states the contract every chapter of this textbook obeys. It is frozen at session T.0
and consumed by every later chapter (T.G, T.D, T.E, T.S, T.Z, and the `*.W` code-tours as a
recommendation). A later chapter that cannot be written within this register must surface the
constraint as a discovery and flex C-Textbook at an inflection review — not silently raise the level.

### Audience floor

The reader has a full undergraduate mathematics background:

- **Proofs.** Comfortable reading and writing $\varepsilon$–$\delta$ arguments, induction,
  contradiction, and direct proof. Knows what it means for a proof to be rigorous.
- **Algebra.** Groups, rings, fields, homomorphisms, quotients, ideals. Polynomial rings. The
  isomorphism theorems. Finite fields $\mathbb{F}_q$. Elliptic curves as groups (the chord-and-tangent
  law, the group axioms, the order of a point). Dedekind domains and unique factorisation of ideals
  are introduced in the Prerequisites chapter and used in the GNFS chapter.
- **Analysis.** Big-$O$ and little-$o$ notation. Limits. The prime number theorem (statement only).
  Logarithms and exponentials. The $L$-notation for subexponential functions is introduced in the
  Prerequisites chapter.
- **Probability.** Discrete probability spaces, expectation, the birthday paradox. The density of
  smooth numbers (Canfield–Erdős–Pomerance) is stated and motivated in the Prerequisites chapter.
- **Logic.** Propositional and first-order logic at the level of a first proof-writing course.
  Computability and complexity at the level of knowing what $\mathbf{P}$, $\mathbf{NP}$, and
  polynomial-time reductions are.

**Nothing beyond this floor is assumed.** Anything beyond is built up in text or cited with a
precise reference. A later chapter that genuinely requires graduate-level background (e.g. étale
cohomology for the Weil conjectures, or the theory of $p$-adic representations) must surface this
as a C-Textbook flex, not silently assume it.

### Depth

**Survey with proof-sketch depth.** Every key theorem is stated precisely and motivated; proofs are
sketches with citations to the full proof, *except* where the proof is the pedagogical payoff. The
designated payoff proofs — where the proof *is* the lesson — are given in full:

- The $L$-notation subexponentiality derivation for GNFS (T.G chapter).
- The MOV reduction (T.E chapter).

All other proofs are sketches: the key idea is stated, the main steps are named, and a citation
points to the full argument. The sketch is honest — it does not pretend to be a proof, and it does
not omit the key idea.

**Complete:** no key idea is silently omitted. If a theorem is used, it is stated. If an algorithm
depends on a non-obvious mathematical fact, that fact is named and cited.

**Academic and clinical:** the register is precise and unsentimental. Intuition leads, rigour
follows — but the rigour is there.

**Not exhaustive:** no encyclopaedic case enumeration. The goal is understanding, not a reference
manual. Edge cases are noted when they are pedagogically important; otherwise they are cited.

**Not inscrutable:** every section opens with the intuition before the formalism. A reader who
skips the proofs should still understand what is true and why it matters.

### Through-line

**Structure-based escape from search.** Every algorithm in this textbook is a story about finding
exploitable structure — a group homomorphism, a smoothness phenomenon, an endomorphism, a pairing,
a quantum period — that escapes the generic $\sqrt{n}$ or $L$-notation search bound. This
through-line is stated once in the Escape-from-Search chapter and revisited at the opening of every
subsequent chapter.

### Markup

**Markdown + MathJax.** Inline mathematics uses `$…$`; display mathematics uses `$$…$$`. This
supersedes the earlier "rST or Markdown TBD" in the ROADMAP Phase τ scope contract. Rationale:
zero migration (every artifact stays `.md`), renders on GitHub and in standard Markdown viewers,
and lets trivial inline glyphs stay as Unicode while non-trivial expressions use TeX delimiters.
The TeX source is the same notation the textbook would use under any tooling. Reopen only on a
hard MathJax limitation (a renderer the project must target that lacks MathJax).

Trivial inline glyphs ($\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{F}_2$, $\equiv$, subscripts) may remain as Unicode
where they read naturally. Non-trivial expressions — fractions, limits, aligned derivations,
matrices, sub/superscript stacks — use MathJax delimiters.

### Artifact location

**`docs/MATHEMATICS.md`** (single file). Chapters are appended to this file as they are written
(T.G appends the GNFS chapter; T.D, T.E, T.S append their chapters at their respective ◆
boundaries). Promote to `docs/textbook/` only if the single file becomes unwieldy — decide at T.Z
(the textbook bind) and record the decision here.

### Chapter-pairing pattern

Each textbook chapter is the maths-first sibling of a `PEDAGOGY.md` code-tour chapter. The
pairing is:

| Textbook chapter (this file) | Code-tour chapter |
|------------------------------|-------------------|
| §Pollard Rho (ECDLP) | `docs/PEDAGOGY.md` |
| §α-Substrate | `shared/numth/docs/PEDAGOGY.md` |
| §GNFS (T.G, to be appended) | `gnfs/docs/PEDAGOGY.md` (integrative chapter) |
| §NFS-DL (T.D, to be appended) | `gnfs/docs/PEDAGOGY.md` (NFS-DL chapter) |
| §Algebraic ECDLP Attacks (T.E) | `gnfs/docs/PEDAGOGY.md` (Track E chapter) |
| §Shor + Post-Quantum (T.S) | `gnfs/docs/PEDAGOGY.md` (Track S chapter) |

The code-tour cites the textbook chapter for the mathematics; the textbook chapter cites the
code-tour for the realisation. Neither is a prerequisite for the other — they are complementary
lenses on the same material.

## Escape from Search: The Through-Line

### The generic search bound

Every cryptographic hardness assumption rests, at bottom, on the difficulty of a *search problem*:
find $k$ such that $k \cdot G = Q$ (the discrete logarithm), or find $p$ such that $p \mid N$ (the
factoring problem). The naive approach is exhaustive search: try every candidate. For a group of
order $n$, this costs $O(n)$ operations.

The first non-trivial observation is that exhaustive search is never necessary. The **birthday
paradox** gives a generic lower bound on what any algorithm must do, and a generic algorithm that
meets it: by sampling $O(\sqrt{n})$ random elements of a group of order $n$, one expects a
collision — two samples that land on the same element. Pollard's rho algorithm (1978) exploits this
to solve the discrete logarithm in $O(\sqrt{n})$ group operations, and Shank's baby-step/giant-step
algorithm achieves the same bound with $O(\sqrt{n})$ space. For the factoring problem, Fermat's
method and its descendants give $O(N^{1/4})$ operations for a balanced semiprime.

The $\sqrt{n}$ barrier is the **generic search bound**: it is what any algorithm achieves without
exploiting the specific structure of the problem. For a 256-bit elliptic curve group ($n \approx
2^{256}$), the generic bound is $2^{128}$ operations — the security level of ECC-256.

### Escaping the bound: the taxonomy of structures

The algorithms in this textbook all escape the generic bound by finding exploitable structure. The
structures fall into five families:

**1. Group homomorphisms (index calculus, smoothness).** If the group $G$ admits a homomorphism
$\phi: G \to H$ where $H$ has a known structure (e.g. $H = \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$), then the
discrete logarithm in $G$ reduces to a problem in $H$. The key instance is *smoothness*: if the
group elements can be expressed as products of a small set of generators (the *factor base*), then
the discrete logarithm reduces to a system of linear equations over $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$. This
is the engine of index calculus, NFS, and NFS-DL.

**2. Endomorphisms (GLV, Koblitz).** An endomorphism $\phi: E \to E$ of an elliptic curve satisfies
$\phi(P) = \lambda P$ for all $P$, where $\lambda$ is a fixed scalar. This collapses the orbit
$\{P, \phi(P), \phi^2(P), \ldots\}$ to a single representative, reducing the effective group size
and the cost of Pollard rho. The GLV decomposition (Gallant–Lambert–Vanstone) and the Koblitz
automorphism are the canonical instances.

**3. Pairings (MOV reduction).** A bilinear pairing $e: E[n] \times E[n] \to \mu_n$ maps the
discrete logarithm on an elliptic curve to the discrete logarithm in a multiplicative group
$\mathbb{F}_{p^k}^*$, where index calculus applies. The MOV/Frey–Rück reduction (Menezes–Okamoto–
Vanstone, Frey–Rück) is the canonical instance; it is the cross-track bridge of this project.

**4. Number-field structure (GNFS, NFS-DL).** The integers $\mathbb{Z}$ embed into a number field
$K = \mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$, where the norm map $N_{K/\mathbb{Q}}$ connects factorisation in $K$ to
factorisation in $\mathbb{Z}$. The GNFS exploits this by sieving for *smooth norms* — elements of
$\mathbb{Z}[\alpha]$ whose norms factor completely over a small factor base — and then using linear
algebra to find a congruence of squares $x^2 \equiv y^2 \pmod{N}$. The subexponential complexity
$L_N[1/3, (64/9)^{1/3}]$ arises from the optimal balance between the sieving cost and the
smoothness probability.

**5. Quantum period-finding (Shor).** Shor's algorithm (1994) uses the quantum Fourier transform to
find the period of the function $f(k) = g^k \bmod N$ in polynomial time. This dissolves the
$\sqrt{n}$ barrier entirely in the quantum model, reducing both factoring and discrete logarithm to
polynomial time. The structure exploited is the *periodicity* of modular exponentiation — a
structure that classical algorithms cannot access efficiently.

### The L-notation hierarchy

The complexity of the best known algorithms for the main problems forms a hierarchy:

$$L_N[\alpha, c] = \exp\!\left(c \cdot (\log N)^\alpha \cdot (\log \log N)^{1-\alpha}\right)$$

- **Fully exponential** ($\alpha = 1$): $L_N[1, c] = N^c$. Generic search (baby-step/giant-step,
  Pollard rho) for ECDLP on a generic curve.
- **Subexponential** ($0 < \alpha < 1$): $L_N[\alpha, c]$. Index calculus for DLP in
  $\mathbb{F}_p^*$ ($\alpha = 1/2$); GNFS for factoring and NFS-DL ($\alpha = 1/3$).
- **Quasi-polynomial** ($\alpha \to 0$): $L_N[0, c] = (\log N)^c$. The Barbulescu–Gaudry–Joux–
  Thomé algorithm for DLP in small-characteristic fields (2014).
- **Polynomial** ($\alpha = 0$, exactly): Shor's algorithm for both factoring and DLP.

The through-line of this textbook is the story of how each step down this hierarchy is achieved by
finding a new kind of exploitable structure.

### Why the bound matters

The $\sqrt{n}$ generic bound is not just a complexity statement — it is a *security guarantee*. A
256-bit elliptic curve group provides 128-bit security *if and only if* no algorithm beats the
generic bound on that curve. The moment a structural exploit is found (an endomorphism, a pairing
with small embedding degree, a special field structure), the security level collapses. The history
of cryptanalysis is a history of finding such structures in curves and fields that were believed to
be generic.

This is why the through-line matters: understanding *which* structures enable *which* escapes is
the key to both attacking and defending cryptographic systems.

## Prerequisites

This chapter collects the specific theorems from algebra, analysis, probability, and logic that
later chapters lean on. Each theorem is stated precisely; the proof is either sketched (with a
citation to the full argument) or, where the proof is short and illuminating, given in full.

A reader who is comfortable with all of these results can proceed directly to any chapter. A reader
who needs to review specific topics should consult the cited references.

### Algebra

#### Groups, rings, and fields

**Definition (group).** A *group* $(G, \cdot)$ is a set $G$ with a binary operation $\cdot$ that
is associative, has an identity element $e$, and has inverses. A group is *abelian* (or
*commutative*) if $a \cdot b = b \cdot a$ for all $a, b \in G$. The *order* of $G$, written $|G|$,
is the cardinality of $G$. The *order* of an element $g \in G$ is the smallest positive integer $k$
such that $g^k = e$.

**Theorem (Lagrange).** *If $H$ is a subgroup of a finite group $G$, then $|H|$ divides $|G|$.*

*Proof sketch.* The cosets $gH$ partition $G$ into equal-sized pieces of size $|H|$. $\square$

**Corollary.** *The order of any element $g \in G$ divides $|G|$.*

**Definition (cyclic group).** A group $G$ is *cyclic* if there exists $g \in G$ such that every
element of $G$ is a power of $g$. Such a $g$ is called a *generator* of $G$.

**Theorem (structure of cyclic groups).** *Every cyclic group of order $n$ is isomorphic to
$\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$. Every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.*

**Definition (ring, field).** A *ring* $(R, +, \cdot)$ is an abelian group under $+$ with a
compatible multiplication that is associative and distributes over $+$. A *field* is a commutative
ring in which every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse.

**Theorem (finite fields).** *For every prime power $q = p^k$, there exists a unique (up to
isomorphism) field $\mathbb{F}_q$ with $q$ elements. The multiplicative group $\mathbb{F}_q^*$ is
cyclic of order $q - 1$.*

*Proof sketch.* Existence: $\mathbb{F}_{p^k}$ is the splitting field of $x^{p^k} - x$ over
$\mathbb{F}_p$. Uniqueness: any two fields with $q$ elements are both splitting fields of the same
polynomial, hence isomorphic. Cyclicity of $\mathbb{F}_q^*$: a finite subgroup of the
multiplicative group of any field is cyclic (the key lemma: a polynomial of degree $d$ over a
field has at most $d$ roots, so the number of elements of order dividing $d$ is at most $d$, which
forces the group to be cyclic). $\square$

#### Ideals and factorisation in Dedekind domains

**Definition (ideal).** An *ideal* $\mathfrak{a}$ in a ring $R$ is a non-empty subset closed under
addition and under multiplication by any element of $R$. A *prime ideal* $\mathfrak{p}$ is an ideal
such that $ab \in \mathfrak{p}$ implies $a \in \mathfrak{p}$ or $b \in \mathfrak{p}$.

**Definition (Dedekind domain).** A *Dedekind domain* is an integral domain $R$ that is Noetherian,
integrally closed in its fraction field, and has Krull dimension 1 (every non-zero prime ideal is
maximal).

**Theorem (unique factorisation of ideals in Dedekind domains).** *In a Dedekind domain, every
non-zero ideal factors uniquely as a product of prime ideals.*

*Proof sketch.* The key steps are: (1) every ideal is contained in a maximal ideal; (2) the
fractional ideals form a group under multiplication; (3) the group of fractional ideals is free
abelian on the prime ideals. The proof uses the Noetherian condition to guarantee termination of
the factorisation process. See Neukirch [N99, §I.3] for the full argument. $\square$

**Why this matters for GNFS.** The ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$ of a number field $K =
\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ is a Dedekind domain. The GNFS exploits the unique factorisation of ideals in
$\mathcal{O}_K$ to connect smoothness of norms in $\mathbb{Z}$ to smoothness of ideals in
$\mathcal{O}_K$. The *bad primes* — primes dividing the index $[\mathcal{O}_K : \mathbb{Z}[\alpha]]$
— are exactly the primes where $\mathbb{Z}[\alpha]$ fails to be a Dedekind domain, and they require
special handling (the Dedekind index criterion).

#### Elliptic curves

**Definition (elliptic curve).** An *elliptic curve* over a field $k$ is a smooth projective curve
of genus 1 with a specified base point $\mathcal{O}$. In short Weierstrass form (valid when
$\mathrm{char}(k) \neq 2, 3$):

$$E: y^2 = x^3 + ax + b, \quad \Delta = -16(4a^3 + 27b^2) \neq 0.$$

The condition $\Delta \neq 0$ ensures smoothness (no cusps or self-intersections).

**Theorem (group law).** *The points of $E(k)$ (including the point at infinity $\mathcal{O}$)
form an abelian group under the chord-and-tangent law, with $\mathcal{O}$ as the identity.*

*Proof sketch.* Associativity is the non-trivial part; it follows from the Riemann–Roch theorem
applied to the divisor class group of $E$. The explicit addition formulas (slope, $x$-coordinate,
$y$-coordinate) are derived from the intersection of a line with the cubic. $\square$

**Theorem (Hasse's bound).** *For an elliptic curve $E$ over $\mathbb{F}_p$,*

$$\left| |E(\mathbb{F}_p)| - (p + 1) \right| \leq 2\sqrt{p}.$$

*Proof sketch.* The bound follows from the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields
(Weil's theorem): the eigenvalues of Frobenius on the Tate module have absolute value $\sqrt{p}$.
See Silverman [S09, §V.1]. $\square$

**Why this matters.** Hasse's bound says the group order $|E(\mathbb{F}_p)|$ lies in the interval
$[p + 1 - 2\sqrt{p},\, p + 1 + 2\sqrt{p}]$. For ECM (Lenstra's method), this means that by
choosing different curves, one can vary the group order over an interval of width $4\sqrt{p}$
around $p$, and hope to find a curve whose order is smooth.

#### The Chinese Remainder Theorem

**Theorem (CRT).** *Let $m_1, \ldots, m_k$ be pairwise coprime positive integers, and let $M =
m_1 \cdots m_k$. Then the natural ring homomorphism*

$$\mathbb{Z}/M\mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{\;\sim\;} \mathbb{Z}/m_1\mathbb{Z} \times \cdots \times
\mathbb{Z}/m_k\mathbb{Z}$$

*is an isomorphism.*

*Proof.* The map $x \mapsto (x \bmod m_1, \ldots, x \bmod m_k)$ is a ring homomorphism. Injectivity
follows from $\gcd(m_i, m_j) = 1$; surjectivity follows from Bézout's identity. $\square$

**Why this matters.** CRT is used in the GNFS square-root step (Couveignes' algorithm computes the
algebraic square root modulo many primes and lifts via CRT), in Pohlig–Hellman (reducing ECDLP in
a group of composite order to ECDLP in prime-order subgroups), and in the construction of
deterministic Miller–Rabin witness sets.

### Analysis

#### Big-$O$ and $L$-notation

**Definition (big-$O$).** $f(n) = O(g(n))$ as $n \to \infty$ if there exist constants $C > 0$ and
$n_0$ such that $|f(n)| \leq C \cdot g(n)$ for all $n \geq n_0$.

**Definition ($L$-notation).** For $0 \leq \alpha \leq 1$ and $c > 0$, define

$$L_N[\alpha, c] = \exp\!\left(c \cdot (\log N)^\alpha \cdot (\log \log N)^{1-\alpha}\right).$$

This interpolates between polynomial ($\alpha = 0$: $L_N[0, c] = (\log N)^c$) and fully
exponential ($\alpha = 1$: $L_N[1, c] = N^c$). The intermediate regime $0 < \alpha < 1$ is
*subexponential*: faster than any polynomial in $\log N$ but slower than any polynomial in $N$.

**Lemma ($L$-notation arithmetic).** *For $0 < \alpha < 1$:*

$$L_N[\alpha, c_1] \cdot L_N[\alpha, c_2] = L_N[\alpha, c_1 + c_2], \qquad
L_N[\alpha, c]^k = L_N[\alpha, kc].$$

*Moreover, $L_N[\alpha, c] = o(N^\varepsilon)$ for every $\varepsilon > 0$, and $L_N[\alpha, c] =
\omega((\log N)^M)$ for every $M > 0$.*

*Proof.* Direct computation from the definition. $\square$

**Why this matters.** The $L$-notation is the natural language for stating the complexity of
subexponential algorithms. The GNFS achieves $L_N[1/3, (64/9)^{1/3}]$; the Pohlig–Hellman
reduction achieves $L_p[1/2, 1]$ for the largest prime factor $p$ of the group order; Shor's
algorithm achieves $O((\log N)^3)$. The exponent $\alpha$ is the key invariant: it determines
whether the algorithm is polynomial, subexponential, or exponential in the input size.

#### The prime number theorem

**Theorem (prime number theorem).** *Let $\pi(x)$ denote the number of primes $\leq x$. Then*

$$\pi(x) \sim \frac{x}{\log x} \quad \text{as } x \to \infty.$$

*Equivalently, the $n$-th prime $p_n \sim n \log n$.*

*Proof sketch.* The proof uses the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty n^{-s}$ and
the fact that $\zeta(s)$ has no zeros on the line $\mathrm{Re}(s) = 1$. See Davenport [D00,
Chapter 13]. $\square$

**Why this matters.** The prime number theorem controls the size of factor bases: the number of
primes up to $B$ is approximately $B / \log B$. This enters the complexity analysis of every
sieve-based algorithm.

### Probability

#### The birthday paradox

**Theorem (birthday bound).** *If $m$ elements are chosen uniformly at random (with replacement)
from a set of size $n$, the probability that at least two are equal is approximately*

$$1 - e^{-m^2/(2n)} \approx \frac{m^2}{2n} \quad \text{for } m \ll n.$$

*In particular, the expected number of draws before a collision is $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$.*

*Proof.* The probability that all $m$ draws are distinct is $\prod_{k=0}^{m-1}(1 - k/n) \approx
e^{-m(m-1)/(2n)}$ for $m \ll n$. Setting this equal to $1/2$ and solving gives $m \approx
\sqrt{2n \log 2} = \Theta(\sqrt{n})$. $\square$

**Why this matters.** The birthday bound is the foundation of Pollard rho: the expected number of
steps before a collision in a pseudorandom walk on a group of order $n$ is $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$. It
is also the reason that a 256-bit elliptic curve group provides 128-bit security against generic
attacks.

#### Smooth-number density

**Definition ($B$-smooth).** An integer $m$ is *$B$-smooth* if all its prime factors are $\leq B$.

**Theorem (Canfield–Erdős–Pomerance, 1983).** *Let $\Psi(x, y)$ denote the number of $y$-smooth
integers in $[1, x]$. For $u = \log x / \log y$ fixed as $x \to \infty$,*

$$\Psi(x, y) = x \cdot \rho(u) \cdot (1 + o(1)),$$

*where $\rho(u)$ is the Dickman function, defined by $\rho(u) = 1$ for $0 \leq u \leq 1$ and*

$$u \rho'(u) = -\rho(u - 1) \quad \text{for } u > 1.$$

*For large $u$, $\rho(u) = u^{-u(1 + o(1))}$.*

*Proof sketch.* The key step is to count integers in $[1, x]$ whose largest prime factor is $\leq
y$, by conditioning on the largest prime factor and applying the prime number theorem. The Dickman
function arises as the continuous analogue of this recursion. See Granville [G08] for a modern
treatment. $\square$

**Corollary (smoothness probability in $L$-notation).** *If $x = N$ and $y = L_N[1/3, c]$, then*

$$\frac{\Psi(N, y)}{N} = L_N[-1/3, -1/(3c)] \cdot (1 + o(1)).$$

*This is the key estimate in the GNFS complexity analysis: the probability that a random integer
near $N$ is $L_N[1/3, c]$-smooth is $L_N[-1/3, \ldots]$, which is subexponentially small but
much larger than $N^{-\varepsilon}$ for any fixed $\varepsilon > 0$.*

**Why this matters.** The smooth-number density theorem is the engine of every sieve-based
algorithm. The GNFS complexity $L_N[1/3, (64/9)^{1/3}]$ arises from optimising the balance between
the smoothness probability (which improves as the smoothness bound $B$ grows) and the cost of the
linear algebra step (which grows with $B$). The optimal $B = L_N[1/3, c]$ for some constant $c$,
and the exponent $1/3$ is the result of this optimisation.

### Logic and complexity

#### Polynomial-time reductions

**Definition (polynomial-time reduction).** A problem $A$ *polynomial-time reduces* to a problem
$B$ (written $A \leq_P B$) if there is a polynomial-time algorithm that transforms any instance of
$A$ into an instance of $B$ such that the answer is preserved.

**Why this matters.** The MOV reduction (T.E chapter) is a polynomial-time reduction from ECDLP
on a curve with small embedding degree to DLP in $\mathbb{F}_{p^k}^*$. Pohlig–Hellman is a
polynomial-time reduction from ECDLP in a group of composite order to ECDLP in prime-order
subgroups. Understanding reductions is essential for understanding why these attacks work.

#### Fermat's little theorem and Euler's criterion

**Theorem (Fermat's little theorem).** *If $p$ is prime and $\gcd(a, p) = 1$, then $a^{p-1} \equiv
1 \pmod{p}$.*

*Proof.* The map $x \mapsto ax$ is a bijection on $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^*$, so $\prod_{x=1}^{p-1}
(ax) \equiv \prod_{x=1}^{p-1} x \pmod{p}$, giving $a^{p-1} \equiv 1$. $\square$

**Theorem (Euler's criterion).** *For an odd prime $p$ and $\gcd(a, p) = 1$,*

$$a^{(p-1)/2} \equiv \left(\frac{a}{p}\right) \pmod{p},$$

*where $\left(\frac{a}{p}\right)$ is the Legendre symbol: $+1$ if $a$ is a quadratic residue mod
$p$, $-1$ if not.*

*Proof.* The multiplicative group $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^*$ is cyclic of order $p - 1$. An
element $a$ is a square iff $a^{(p-1)/2} = 1$ (since squaring is a 2-to-1 map on the group). The
non-residues satisfy $a^{(p-1)/2} = -1$ (the only other square root of $1$ in a field). $\square$

**Why this matters.** Fermat's little theorem is the basis of Miller–Rabin primality testing and of
the Fermat primality test. Euler's criterion is the basis of the Legendre symbol computation and
the Tonelli–Shanks square root algorithm.

#### The discrete logarithm problem

**Definition (DLP).** Let $G$ be a cyclic group of order $n$ with generator $g$. Given $h \in G$,
the *discrete logarithm problem* (DLP) asks for the unique $k \in \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}$ such that
$g^k = h$.

**Definition (ECDLP).** The *elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem* (ECDLP) is the DLP in the
group $E(\mathbb{F}_p)$ of points on an elliptic curve over a prime field.

**Why hardness is believed.** No polynomial-time classical algorithm is known for the DLP or ECDLP
in a generic group. The best known classical algorithms for ECDLP on a generic curve run in
$\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ time (Pollard rho, baby-step/giant-step). For DLP in $\mathbb{F}_p^*$, the best
known algorithms run in $L_p[1/3, (64/9)^{1/3}]$ time (NFS-DL). The hardness of these problems is
a *computational assumption*, not a theorem — no proof that they require superpolynomial time is
known.

## On Scale: A Natural-Philosophy Interlude

*This interlude is the full exposition deferred from the ROADMAP's `## On scale` section. The
ROADMAP states the clinical summary; this chapter provides the natural-philosophy context that
belongs in a textbook register, not a planning document.*

### The word "scale" is not one thing

Every chapter in this textbook involves a comparison between "toy scale" and "real scale" — between
the parameters at which the algorithms are demonstrated here and the parameters at which they are
deployed in practice. The comparison is essential for honest pedagogy: an algorithm that is
"correct" at toy scale may be missing engineering that only matters at real scale, and a phenomenon
that is "prominent" at toy scale may wash out at real scale.

But the comparison is routinely made carelessly, as if "scale" were a single axis — a ladder from
small to large, with toy instances at the bottom and RSA-2048 at the top. It is not. At least three
distinct things travel under the word, and they do not form one ordered line.

### Axis 1: Resource/operational scale

The first axis is the one most people mean: how large an instance one can actually run. Toy scale
here means roughly 80-bit $N$ on a laptop; "NFS scale" means RSA-768 ($N \approx 2^{768}$) on a
cluster-month, or RSA-829 ($N \approx 2^{829}$) on a larger cluster. This axis *is* an unbounded
ladder — bigger $N$ always exists, up to a physical-computation ceiling.

But this axis is **phenomenologically flat**: scaling $N$ alone introduces no new mathematics. It
makes the same machinery bigger and improves the statistics. This is exactly why *over-exposed*
phenomena (bad primes, for instance) *wash out* at large $N$ rather than changing in kind: at
cryptographic scale, the contribution of bad primes is marginal and largely absorbed by polynomial
selection, but at toy scale with a hand-picked polynomial they are unavoidable and must be handled
head-on. The honest annotation is that the prominence is a toy-scale artifact, not the typical
NFS-scale picture.

The flatness of this axis is also why the GNFS complexity $L_N[1/3, (64/9)^{1/3}]$ is a
*heuristic*, not a theorem: the smoothness-probability estimates that drive the analysis are
asymptotic, and the asymptotic regime is only reached at scales far beyond what any computer can
run. The algorithm is correct at toy scale; the complexity analysis is only accurate at a scale
that is, in a precise sense, unreachable.

### Axis 2: Mathematical-dimension scale

The second axis is qualitatively different: the *degree* $d = [K:\mathbb{Q}]$ of the number field,
the *embedding degree* $k$ of a pairing, the *characteristic* vs *extension degree* shape of a
finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$. These are dimensions *of the mathematics*, not of the instance
size.

This axis is **not** a ladder in the same sense. A number field of degree $d = 6$ is not "larger"
than one of degree $d = 3$ in any operational sense — it is *richer*. The ramification structure,
the Galois group, the arithmetic of the ring of integers — all of these change qualitatively as $d$
grows, not just quantitatively. A toy instance over a degree-6 field can exhibit phenomena that a
"huge" instance over a degree-3 field never touches.

This is the axis that drives the most interesting mathematics in this textbook. The MOV reduction
works because the embedding degree $k$ of the target curve is small; the GHS descent works because
the field $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ has a tower structure; the quasi-polynomial DLP algorithm works
because the characteristic is small relative to the extension degree. None of these phenomena are
about instance size — they are about the *shape* of the mathematical object.

### Axis 3: Structural scale

The third axis is the most subtle: *thresholds* where scaling unlocks (or requires) a *different*
machine. These are not just quantitative changes — they are qualitative transitions.

The canonical examples:

- **Large-prime variations.** The basic NFS sieve collects only fully smooth relations. The
  large-prime variation collects *partial* relations — those with one or two large prime cofactors —
  and combines them to form full relations. This variation only pays off once the relation yield is
  large enough that the partial-relation graph has a giant component; at toy scale, the graph is
  sparse and the variation adds overhead without benefit. The threshold is a structural property of
  the relation graph, not a function of $N$ alone.

- **The quasi-polynomial DLP regime.** The Barbulescu–Gaudry–Joux–Thomé algorithm (2014) achieves
  quasi-polynomial complexity for DLP in $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ when the characteristic $p$ is small
  (e.g. $p = 2$). This is not a quantitative improvement on the $L[1/3]$ bound — it is a
  *structural* discovery that the small-characteristic case admits a fundamentally different
  algorithm. The threshold is the ratio $p / n$, not the size of the field.

- **The asymptotic regime of $L$-notation.** The $L$-notation complexity of GNFS is an asymptotic
  statement: it is accurate only when $N$ is large enough that the smoothness-probability estimates
  are reliable. At toy scale, the optimal parameters (smoothness bound $B$, sieve region size) are
  not the asymptotically optimal ones — they are calibrated empirically. The transition to the
  asymptotic regime is a structural threshold, not a smooth function of $N$.

### The three couplings

The three axes are sometimes independent, sometimes coupled, and sometimes structurally enabling.

**Independent:** the degree $d$ and the instance size $N$ are separate knobs. One can choose a
degree-6 number field for a 100-bit $N$, or a degree-3 field for a 1000-bit $N$. The mathematics
of the number field does not depend on $N$ directly.

**Coupled along the efficient frontier.** The *optimal* degree for GNFS is tied to $N$ by

$$d \sim \left(\frac{3 \log N}{\log \log N}\right)^{1/3},$$

so scaling $N$ "properly" (along the efficient frontier) drags $d$ along. At toy scale, the optimal
$d$ is 3 or 4 and barely moves; at RSA-768 scale, $d \approx 6$. The coupling is invisible at toy
scale, which is why toy-scale experiments with $d = 3$ are not misleading — they are just not
exploring the full frontier.

**Structural-enabling.** At certain thresholds, scaling one axis changes *which* mathematics
applies, not just how big it is. The quasi-polynomial DLP regime is the clearest example: the
algorithm is not a quantitative improvement on NFS-DL, it is a different algorithm that only
applies in a specific structural regime. The large-prime variation is another: it requires the
relation graph to have a giant component, which is a structural threshold.

### Method-convergence vs problem-openness

A natural question: is NFS asymptotically convergent? The precise answer distinguishes two things
the word "convergence" blurs.

**Convergence of the method (true).** The GNFS heuristic complexity has sat at $L_N[1/3,
(64/9)^{1/3}]$ since the early 1990s. Three decades of work have improved the constant and the
engineering — not the exponent $1/3$. Within the NFS paradigm (sieve number-field relations for
smoothness, then linear algebra), the exponent has converged. Note even this is *heuristic*,
resting on unproven smoothness assumptions, not a theorem.

**Convergence of the problem (false / open).** The true complexity of factoring and discrete
logarithm is **open**. $L[1/3]$ is a believed barrier for the *general* problem, not a proven
lower bound, and history shows that apparent convergence is repeatedly punctured by structural
discovery:

- The Barbulescu–Gaudry–Joux–Thomé quasi-polynomial algorithm (2014) collapsed small-characteristic
  DLP — a regime everyone had taken to be $L[1/3]$ — to $L[0, c]$.
- Shor's algorithm (1994) dissolves the barrier entirely in the quantum model.

The plateau is real, but it is a plateau of *one method*. It is reset, not approached, by new
mathematical structure.

### The honest science↔engineering gap

This textbook implements the mathematics of these algorithms completely. It does not implement the
engineering optimisations that make them run at cryptographic scale. The gap is real and is
annotated explicitly wherever it appears.

The gap runs in both directions:

**Under-exposed at toy scale.** Some phenomena only appear at large scale. Large-prime variations
only pay off once relation yield is in the millions. Block-Lanczos convergence behaviour that a
tiny matrix never stresses. The optimal-degree coupling between $d$ and $N$ that is invisible at
$d = 3$. These are implemented at *demonstration fidelity* — the mathematical content is present,
but the payoff is unreachable here. The annotation says: the mathematics is correct; the
engineering scale to exhibit the payoff is out of scope.

**Over-exposed at toy scale.** Some phenomena are more prominent at toy scale than at real scale.
Bad primes (primes dividing $\mathrm{disc}(f)$) are marginal at cryptographic scale but unavoidable
at toy scale with a hand-picked polynomial. The annotation says: this prominence is a toy-scale
artifact; at real scale it washes out.

The disconnect itself is pedagogical content. Part of honestly surveying how these algorithms
behave at the scales they were designed for is acknowledging what toy scale can and cannot exhibit.

## Pollard Rho for ECDLP

*Maths-first sibling to `docs/PEDAGOGY.md`. For the code-tour — phase-by-phase implementation
narrative, optimisation sequence, benchmarks, and CLI — see `docs/PEDAGOGY.md`. For the
prerequisites used in this chapter, see §Prerequisites above.*

### The through-line for this chapter

Pollard rho for ECDLP is the canonical example of **structure-based escape from search via group
homomorphism**. The structure exploited is the *linear representation* of walk states: every point
in the walk is a known linear combination $W = a \cdot G + b \cdot Q$ of the generator $G$ and the
target $Q$. A collision in the walk — two states that land on the same group element — immediately
yields a linear equation in the unknown discrete logarithm $k$. The birthday paradox guarantees
that such a collision occurs after $O(\sqrt{n})$ steps, where $n = |E(\mathbb{F}_p)|$.

The escape from the generic $O(n)$ exhaustive search is not a reduction in the *difficulty* of the
problem — it is a reduction in the *search space* from $n$ to $\sqrt{n}$, achieved by the birthday
paradox. The group homomorphism structure (the linear invariant $W = aG + bQ$) is what makes the
collision *useful*: without it, a collision would be a dead end.

### The birthday-paradox collision argument

Let $G$ be a cyclic group of prime order $n$, with generator $G$ and target $Q = k \cdot G$. A
*pseudorandom walk* on $G$ is a sequence $W_0, W_1, W_2, \ldots$ where each $W_{i+1} = f(W_i)$
for some deterministic function $f: G \to G$ that behaves like a random function.

**The key invariant.** The walk maintains scalars $a_i, b_i \in \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ such that

$$W_i = a_i \cdot G + b_i \cdot Q$$

at every step. The function $f$ is chosen so that $a_{i+1}$ and $b_{i+1}$ can be computed from
$a_i$ and $b_i$ in $O(1)$ time.

**The collision.** Suppose $W_i = W_j$ for $i \neq j$. Then

$$a_i \cdot G + b_i \cdot Q = a_j \cdot G + b_j \cdot Q,$$

so $(a_i - a_j) \cdot G = (b_j - b_i) \cdot Q = (b_j - b_i) \cdot k \cdot G$, giving

$$k \equiv \frac{a_i - a_j}{b_j - b_i} \pmod{n}$$

provided $b_j \not\equiv b_i \pmod{n}$ (which holds with probability $1 - 1/n$; if it fails, retry
with a fresh walk).

**The birthday bound.** If $f$ behaves like a random function on $G$, the expected number of steps
before a collision is $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ by the birthday paradox (§Prerequisites). This is the
$O(\sqrt{n})$ complexity of Pollard rho.

### The $r$-adding walk and mixing

The naive pseudorandom walk — "add a random point at each step" — has poor mixing properties: the
walk tends to cluster near its starting point, and the birthday bound is not achieved in practice.
Teske (1998) showed that an *$r$-adding walk* mixes much better.

**Definition ($r$-adding walk).** Precompute a table of $r$ random addends $R[0], \ldots, R[r-1]$,
where $R[i] = \alpha_i \cdot G + \beta_i \cdot Q$ with random scalars $\alpha_i, \beta_i$. At each
step, select the addend by $i = x \bmod r$ (where $x$ is a low word of the current point's
$x$-coordinate), then set

$$W \leftarrow W + R[i], \quad a \leftarrow a + \alpha_i \bmod n, \quad b \leftarrow b + \beta_i
\bmod n.$$

With $r \approx 20$, the walk behaves like a random function on the group, and the birthday bound
is achieved in practice.

**Why mixing matters.** The birthday bound $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ assumes that the walk visits group
elements uniformly at random. A poorly mixing walk may visit some elements many times and others
never, increasing the expected collision time. The $r$-adding walk is designed to avoid this by
making the step function depend on the current point in a way that spreads the walk across the
group.

### Floyd's cycle detection

The walk $W_0, W_1, W_2, \ldots$ is eventually periodic: since $G$ is finite, the walk must
revisit a point, and from that point on it follows the same trajectory. The *rho* shape — a tail
leading into a cycle — gives the algorithm its name.

**Floyd's algorithm.** Run two pointers: the *tortoise* at speed 1 ($W_i$) and the *hare* at speed
2 ($W_{2i}$). When the hare catches the tortoise ($W_i = W_{2i}$), a collision has been detected.
The collision yields the discrete logarithm as above.

**Brent's improvement.** Freeze the tortoise at the start of each power-of-2 window; advance only
the hare. Compare the hare to the frozen tortoise at each step. After $2^k$ comparisons without
collision, snap the tortoise forward to the hare's position and double the window. This reduces the
number of function evaluations by approximately 24% compared to Floyd's algorithm.

**Expected complexity.** The expected number of steps before the hare catches the tortoise is
$\Theta(\sqrt{n})$, matching the birthday bound. The constant factor depends on the mixing
properties of the walk.

### The group-homomorphism structure

The reason Pollard rho works on elliptic curves — and not just on abstract groups — is the
*group-homomorphism structure* of the walk. The key point is that the elliptic curve group law is
*computable*: given two points $P$ and $Q$ on $E(\mathbb{F}_p)$, one can compute $P + Q$ in $O(1)$
field operations. This means the walk can be implemented efficiently, and the linear invariant
$W = aG + bQ$ can be maintained at each step.

More precisely: the map $(a, b) \mapsto aG + bQ$ is a group homomorphism from $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}
\times \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ to $E(\mathbb{F}_p)$. The walk on $E(\mathbb{F}_p)$ lifts to a walk
on $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$, and a collision in the former gives a
linear equation in the latter. The discrete logarithm is the solution to that equation.

This is the general pattern of index calculus: find a homomorphism from the group to a structure
where the discrete logarithm is easy, and use it to reduce the hard problem to an easy one. In
Pollard rho, the "easy structure" is just the linear equation $k \equiv (a_i - a_j)/(b_j - b_i)
\pmod{n}$, which is trivial to solve.

### Distinguished points and parallel collision search

The single-threaded Floyd/Brent algorithm is inherently sequential: the tortoise and hare must stay
in sync. The *distinguished-point* (DP) method (van Oorschot–Wiener, 1999) breaks this dependency
and enables linear parallelism.

**Definition (distinguished point).** A point $W \in E(\mathbb{F}_p)$ is *distinguished* if its
$x$-coordinate has at least $\theta$ low-order zero bits. The expected number of steps between
distinguished points is $2^\theta$.

**The parallel architecture.** $N$ walker threads each run an independent $r$-adding walk and emit
a record $(x, a, b)$ whenever the walk lands on a distinguished point. A coordinator thread
maintains a hash table keyed on $x$. When two records with the same $x$ but different $(a, b)$
pairs arrive, the coordinator solves for $k$.

**Why it works.** Two walks that ever visit the same point will, from that point on, follow
identical trajectories (the walk is deterministic). They will therefore hit the same distinguished
points. A collision in the DP table implies a collision in the underlying walks, which implies the
DLP can be recovered.

**Speedup.** With $N$ walkers, the expected wall-time steps to collision is $O(\sqrt{n} / N)$ —
linear speedup in the number of walkers. This is the second pedagogical moment: the speedup from
parallelism is linear, not $\sqrt{N}$.

### Orbit-collapsing maps: negation and GLV

The birthday bound $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ applies to the *effective group size* — the number of
distinct walk states. By collapsing orbits of the group action, one can reduce the effective group
size and improve the expected collision time.

**The negation map.** On an elliptic curve, $P$ and $-P$ share the same $x$-coordinate (negation
flips only the $y$-coordinate). By collapsing $\{P, -P\}$ to a single canonical representative
(the one with the smaller $y$-coordinate), the effective group size is halved, reducing the
expected walk length by $\sqrt{2}$.

**The GLV endomorphism.** For a curve with an order-3 endomorphism $\phi$ (e.g. $y^2 = x^3 + 7$
over a field with a cube root of unity), the orbit of any generic point $P$ under $\langle \phi,
-1 \rangle$ has size 6:

$$\{P,\; \phi(P),\; \phi^2(P),\; -P,\; -\phi(P),\; -\phi^2(P)\}.$$

Collapsing this orbit to a single canonical representative reduces the effective group size by 6,
reducing the expected walk length by $\sqrt{6}$ compared to the plain walk, or $\sqrt{3}$ compared
to the negation-map-only walk.

**Scalar bookkeeping.** The orbit-collapsing maps require adjusting the scalars $(a, b)$ to
maintain the invariant $W = aG + bQ$. For the negation map: $-W = (n-a)G + (n-b)Q$. For the GLV
endomorphism: $\phi(W) = \lambda W$ where $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue of $\phi$, so $\phi(W) =
(\lambda a)G + (\lambda b)Q$.

**Fruitless cycles.** The canonical map can create *fruitless cycles*: the walk oscillates between
two orbit members that share the same canonical representative, and never hits a distinguished
point. The BKNS escape (Bos–Kleinjung–Niederhagen–Schwabe) handles this deterministically: detect
the period-2 pattern in a sliding window, then perturb by doubling the current point ($W \leftarrow
2W$, $a \leftarrow 2a$, $b \leftarrow 2b$) and re-canonicalising.

### The $L$-notation bound for ECDLP

For a generic elliptic curve over $\mathbb{F}_p$ with $|E(\mathbb{F}_p)| = n$, the best known
classical algorithm runs in $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ group operations. In $L$-notation:

$$\text{ECDLP complexity} = L_n[1, 1/2] = n^{1/2} = \Theta(\sqrt{n}).$$

This is *fully exponential* in $\log n$ — the algorithm is not subexponential. The reason is that
no index-calculus algorithm is known for a generic elliptic curve: the group $E(\mathbb{F}_p)$ does
not have a natural "factor base" structure that would allow smooth-element collection.

**The contrast with DLP in $\mathbb{F}_p^*$.** For the multiplicative group $\mathbb{F}_p^*$, the
best known algorithm (NFS-DL) runs in $L_p[1/3, (64/9)^{1/3}]$ — subexponential. The key
difference is that $\mathbb{F}_p^*$ has a natural factor base (the small primes), while a generic
elliptic curve group does not. This is why ECC-256 provides 128-bit security while RSA-3072 is
needed for the same security level against classical attacks.

**When the bound breaks.** The $\sqrt{n}$ bound is the *generic* bound. It breaks when the curve
has exploitable structure:
- **Small embedding degree** (MOV/Frey–Rück): the ECDLP reduces to DLP in $\mathbb{F}_{p^k}^*$,
  where index calculus applies.
- **Anomalous curves** (Smart–Satoh–Araki): curves with $|E(\mathbb{F}_p)| = p$ admit a
  polynomial-time attack via $p$-adic logarithms.
- **Special field structure** (GHS descent): curves over $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ with a tower
  structure admit a descent to a hyperelliptic Jacobian.

These are the subjects of the T.E chapter.

details, code references, KAT summary, and downstream consumption — see
`shared/numth/docs/PEDAGOGY.md`. For the prerequisites used in this chapter, see §Prerequisites
above.*

### The through-line for this chapter

The α-substrate algorithms are the *infrastructure* of structure-based escape from search. They do
not themselves escape the generic bound — they provide the tools that other algorithms use to do
so. Specifically:

- **Miller–Rabin** decides primality, which is needed to build factor bases and to certify that a
  found factor is prime.
- **Smooth-number detection** identifies the elements that index-calculus algorithms collect; the
  smooth-number density theorem (§Prerequisites) is the mathematical engine of every sieve.
- **ECM** (Lenstra's elliptic-curve method) factors integers by exploiting the variability of
  elliptic-curve group orders — a direct application of the group-homomorphism structure from the
  Pollard rho chapter, now used for factoring rather than discrete logarithm.
- **Tonelli–Shanks** computes square roots modulo a prime, which is needed for curve-point recovery
  and for the GNFS square-root step.

The through-line is: these algorithms are the substrate on which the escape from search is built.
Understanding them is understanding the *tools* of the escape.

### Miller–Rabin primality testing

#### The Fermat test and its failure

The simplest primality test is the *Fermat test*: if $n$ is prime, then $a^{n-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$
for all $a$ with $\gcd(a, n) = 1$ (Fermat's little theorem). A *Fermat pseudoprime* to base $a$ is
a composite $n$ that passes the Fermat test for base $a$.

The Fermat test fails catastrophically for *Carmichael numbers* — composites $n$ that pass the
Fermat test for *every* base $a$ with $\gcd(a, n) = 1$. The smallest Carmichael number is 561 =
$3 \cdot 11 \cdot 17$. There are infinitely many Carmichael numbers (Alford–Granville–Pomerance,
1994), so the Fermat test alone is not a reliable primality test.

#### The Miller–Rabin test

The Miller–Rabin test strengthens the Fermat test by exploiting the structure of square roots of 1
modulo a prime.

**Setup.** Write $n - 1 = 2^s \cdot d$ with $d$ odd. For a witness base $a$, compute $x = a^d
\bmod n$. Then square $x$ up to $s - 1$ times. If the sequence $a^d, a^{2d}, \ldots, a^{2^{s-1}d}$
ever hits $n - 1$ (or starts at 1), the witness $a$ is *satisfied* and offers no evidence of
compositeness. If it never does, $a$ is a *witness to compositeness* and $n$ is definitely
composite.

**Theorem (Miller–Rabin soundness).** *If $n$ is prime, every $a \in (1, n-1)$ is satisfied. If
$n$ is composite, at least $3/4$ of the bases $a \in \{1, \ldots, n-1\}$ are witnesses to
compositeness.*

*Proof sketch.* For a prime $n$, the only square roots of 1 modulo $n$ are $\pm 1$ (since
$\mathbb{F}_n$ is a field). The sequence $a^d, a^{2d}, \ldots$ must therefore hit $\pm 1$ before
reaching $a^{n-1} = 1$; if it hits $-1 = n-1$, the witness is satisfied. For a composite $n$,
the argument uses the structure of the group $(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^*$ and the Chinese Remainder
Theorem to show that at most $1/4$ of the bases are satisfied. See Crandall–Pomerance [CP05, §3.5]
for the full argument. $\square$

**Corollary.** A composite $n$ that passes $k$ independent random bases slips through with
probability at most $4^{-k}$.

#### From probabilistic to deterministic

Miller–Rabin is probabilistic in general, but for bounded $n$ it can be made *deterministic* by
using a fixed witness set known to have no exceptions below a threshold. The key result is:

**Theorem (deterministic Miller–Rabin).** *The 13-base set $\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29,
31, 37\}$ is a deterministic primality test for all $n < 3{,}317{,}044{,}064{,}679{,}887{,}385{,}961{,}981
\approx 2^{81.6}$.*

*Proof.* Computational verification: no composite below the threshold passes all 13 bases. The
threshold and the witness set are from Sorenson–Webster (2017), refining earlier tables by
Pomerance–Selfridge–Wagstaff and Jaeschke. $\square$

**Why this matters.** The deterministic Miller–Rabin test is the primality oracle used throughout
this project. It is used to build factor bases (certifying that each base element is prime), to
certify that a found factor is prime, and inside ECM (to check that the found factor is not 1 or
$N$).

#### Strong pseudoprimes and the 2-Sylow structure

The Miller–Rabin test is more powerful than the Fermat test because it exploits the *2-Sylow
structure* of $(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^*$. Writing $n - 1 = 2^s \cdot d$, the test checks not
just that $a^{n-1} \equiv 1$, but that the sequence of squarings $a^d, a^{2d}, \ldots, a^{2^{s-1}d}$
has the right structure: it must hit $-1$ before reaching $1$ (unless it starts at $1$). This is
exactly the structure that the 2-Sylow subgroup of $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^*$ forces for a prime
$p$.

A *strong pseudoprime* to base $a$ is a composite $n$ that passes the Miller–Rabin test for base
$a$. Strong pseudoprimes are much rarer than Fermat pseudoprimes: the smallest strong pseudoprime
to base 2 is 2047 = $23 \cdot 89$, and it is caught by base 23.

### Smooth-number theory

#### The $B$-smooth density theorem

The Canfield–Erdős–Pomerance theorem (§Prerequisites) gives the density of $B$-smooth integers:
for $u = \log N / \log B$ fixed,

$$\Pr[\text{random integer in } [1, N] \text{ is } B\text{-smooth}] = \rho(u) \cdot (1 + o(1)),$$

where $\rho(u)$ is the Dickman function. For large $u$, $\rho(u) \approx u^{-u}$.

**The key estimate for sieve algorithms.** If $B = L_N[1/3, c]$, then $u = \log N / \log B \sim
(\log N)^{2/3} / (c \cdot (\log \log N)^{1/3})$, and

$$\rho(u) = L_N\!\left[-\frac{1}{3},\, -\frac{1}{3c}\right] \cdot (1 + o(1)).$$

This is the smoothness probability that enters the GNFS complexity analysis. The probability is
subexponentially small, but much larger than $N^{-\varepsilon}$ for any fixed $\varepsilon > 0$.

**Why this matters.** The smooth-number density theorem is the mathematical engine of every sieve.
The GNFS sieve collects pairs $(a, b)$ such that both the rational norm $|a + bm|$ and the
algebraic norm $|N_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(a + b\alpha)|$ are $B$-smooth. The probability that a random
pair is smooth is $\rho(u)^2$ (approximately, for the two independent norms), and the optimal $B$
is chosen to balance this probability against the cost of the linear algebra step.

#### The factor base

**Definition (factor base).** A *factor base* $\mathcal{F}$ is a finite set of primes $\{p_1, p_2,
\ldots, p_k\}$ with $p_k \leq B$. An integer $m$ is $\mathcal{F}$-smooth (or $B$-smooth) if all
its prime factors are in $\mathcal{F}$.

**The smoothness witness.** A *smoothness witness* for $m$ over $\mathcal{F}$ is the factorisation
$m = \prod_{p \in \mathcal{F}} p^{e_p} \cdot r$, where $r$ is the *cofactor* — the part of $m$
not accounted for by $\mathcal{F}$. If $r = 1$, $m$ is fully $\mathcal{F}$-smooth; if $r > 1$, $m$
has a *large prime* cofactor outside the base.

**The large-prime variation.** In the basic sieve, only fully smooth relations are collected. In
the large-prime variation, partial relations (with one or two large prime cofactors) are also
collected. Two partial relations with the same large prime cofactor can be combined to form a full
relation. This variation improves the relation yield at the cost of more complex bookkeeping.

### Lenstra's Elliptic Curve Method (ECM)

#### The idea: Pollard's $p-1$, lifted onto a curve

Pollard's $p-1$ method factors $N$ by exploiting that if $p \mid N$ and $p - 1$ is $B$-smooth,
then for a base $a$, $a^k \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$ once $k = \mathrm{lcm}(1, \ldots, B)$ is a multiple
of the order of $a$ mod $p$. Then $\gcd(a^k - 1, N)$ reveals $p$.

The weakness: it only works when $p - 1$ happens to be smooth — a property of the single fixed
group $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^*$.

**Lenstra's insight (1987).** Replace the fixed group $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^*$ with the group
of points on a *random* elliptic curve $E$ over $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$. The order $|E(\mathbb{F}_p)|$
varies with the curve choice and ranges over an interval around $p$ (Hasse's bound: $|p + 1 -
|E(\mathbb{F}_p)|| \leq 2\sqrt{p}$). If the chosen curve has $B$-smooth order mod some prime $p
\mid N$, then multiplying a starting point $P$ by $k = \prod q^e$ (prime powers $\leq B$) drives
$kP$ to the identity mod $p$ while it stays non-trivial mod $N$. The group law's modular inversion
then fails with a denominator sharing a factor with $N$, and $\gcd(\text{denominator}, N) = p$
falls out.

**The key advantage.** If one curve's order is not smooth, try another curve. ECM converts a
question of luck (is $p - 1$ smooth?) into a question one can re-roll (is *some* curve's order
smooth?).

#### The group-order smoothness argument

**Theorem (ECM expected complexity).** *The expected number of curves ECM must try before finding
a factor $p$ of $N$ is $O(\rho(u))^{-1}$, where $u = \log p / \log B$ and $\rho$ is the Dickman
function. The expected running time per curve is $O(B \log B \log N)$ (for stage 1). The total
expected running time is*

$$O\!\left(B \log B \log N \cdot \rho(u)^{-1}\right) = L_p\!\left[\frac{1}{2},\, \sqrt{2}\right]
\cdot \mathrm{poly}(\log N)$$

*when $B$ is chosen optimally as $B = L_p[1/2, 1/\sqrt{2}]$.*

*Proof sketch.* The probability that a random curve has $B$-smooth order mod $p$ is approximately
$\rho(u)$ (by the Canfield–Erdős–Pomerance theorem applied to the interval $[p + 1 - 2\sqrt{p},
p + 1 + 2\sqrt{p}]$). The optimal $B$ balances the per-curve cost $O(B \log B \log N)$ against the
number of curves $\rho(u)^{-1}$. Setting $B = L_p[1/2, c]$ and optimising over $c$ gives the
stated bound. See Lenstra [L87] and Crandall–Pomerance [CP05, §7.4] for the full argument. $\square$

**The subexponential complexity.** ECM runs in $L_p[1/2, \sqrt{2}]$ time in the size of the
*smallest prime factor* $p$, not in the size of $N$. This makes ECM the right tool for splitting
off small-to-medium prime factors: it is subexponential in $p$, but the cost grows with $p$, so it
is not competitive with NFS for large factors.

#### Montgomery-form curves and the $(X:Z)$ ladder

ECM uses *Montgomery-form curves* $Bv^2 = u^3 + Au^2 + u$ with the *Suyama parameterisation* to
generate a valid (curve, starting point) pair from a single integer $\sigma$. Montgomery form
admits projective $(X:Z)$ coordinates that omit the $Y$-coordinate entirely: scalar multiplication
needs only the $x$-coordinate, computed by the *Montgomery ladder* using *differential addition*
(given $P$, $Q$, and $P - Q$, compute $P + Q$) and doubling.

**Why Montgomery form?** The Montgomery ladder is *uniform* (no branch on the bit of the scalar)
and *efficient* (differential addition uses fewer field operations than the general addition
formula). The $Z = 0$ point represents the identity; a non-invertible denominator in the group law
signals that $\gcd(Z, N) > 1$, which is the factor.

**The Suyama parameterisation.** Given $\sigma$, compute the curve constant $A_{24} = (A+2)/4$ and
a starting point, returning early with a factor if any of the constructions hits a non-invertible
denominator mod $N$ (itself a lucky factor find). The parameterisation ensures that the starting
point has a specific structure that makes stage 1 more likely to succeed.

#### Stage 1 and stage 2

**Stage 1.** Compute $Q = kP$ with $k = \prod \{q^{\lfloor \log_q B_1 \rfloor} : q \text{ prime}
\leq B_1\}$ — every prime power up to $B_1$. After the ladder, test $\gcd(Z, N)$; a non-trivial
gcd is the factor. Stage 1 succeeds when $|E(\mathbb{F}_p)|$ is fully $B_1$-smooth.

**Stage 2.** The standard refinement for the common case where $|E(\mathbb{F}_p)|$ is $B_1$-smooth
*except for one* prime factor $q \in (B_1, B_2]$. Rather than raising $B_1$ (which re-does all
the work), stage 2 walks the multiples $qQ$ for primes $q \in (B_1, B_2]$ using differential
addition with a fixed step, accumulates the product of their $Z$-coordinates, and takes a *single*
gcd with $N$ at the end. This catches the one-large-prime case cheaply.

**The two-stage structure** is the ECM analogue of the large-prime variation in NFS sieving: both
extend the reach of the algorithm by handling the case where the "smooth" condition fails by one
prime factor.

### Tonelli–Shanks: square roots mod $p$

#### The problem

Given a prime $p$ and a quadratic residue $a$ (i.e. $\left(\frac{a}{p}\right) = 1$), find $r$ with
$r^2 \equiv a \pmod{p}$.

#### The 2-Sylow structure argument

The multiplicative group $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^*$ is cyclic of order $p - 1$. Write $p - 1 =
Q \cdot 2^S$ with $Q$ odd. The *2-Sylow subgroup* of $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^*$ is the unique
subgroup of order $2^S$.

**The easy case: $p \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$ (i.e. $S = 1$).** Here $r = a^{(p+1)/4}$ is a square root,
because $r^2 = a^{(p+1)/2} = a \cdot a^{(p-1)/2} = a \cdot 1 = a$ (using Euler's criterion for
a residue). One exponentiation, no search.

**The general case: $p \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$ (i.e. $S \geq 2$).** The Tonelli–Shanks algorithm
maintains a tuple $(M, c, t, r)$ where:
- $M$ is the current "error exponent" (starts at $S$),
- $c$ is a power of a quadratic non-residue $z$ (so $c^{2^{M-1}} = -1$),
- $t = a^Q$ (the "error term": $t^{2^{M-1}} = 1$ iff $r^2 = a$),
- $r = a^{(Q+1)/2}$ (the current candidate square root).

At each step, find the smallest $i$ such that $t^{2^i} = 1$. If $i = 0$, then $t = 1$ and $r^2 =
a$ — done. Otherwise, update:

$$c \leftarrow c^{2^{M-i-1}}, \quad t \leftarrow t \cdot c^2, \quad r \leftarrow r \cdot c,
\quad M \leftarrow i.$$

This reduces the error exponent $M$ at each step, so the algorithm terminates in at most $S - 1$
iterations.

**Finding the quadratic non-residue $z$.** The trial search tests $z = 2, 3, 5, \ldots$ until
$\left(\frac{z}{p}\right) = -1$. Non-residues have density $1/2$, so the expected number of trials
is 2. There is no known fast deterministic way to produce a non-residue (it is related to open
problems about the least quadratic non-residue under GRH), so the trial loop is the standard
practical choice.

**Theorem (Tonelli–Shanks correctness).** *The algorithm terminates in $O(S^2)$ multiplications
and returns $r$ with $r^2 \equiv a \pmod{p}$.*

*Proof sketch.* The invariant $r^2 \equiv a \cdot t \pmod{p}$ is maintained throughout. The error
exponent $M$ strictly decreases at each step (from $M$ to $i < M$), so the algorithm terminates.
At termination, $t = 1$ and $r^2 \equiv a$. $\square$

**Why this matters.** Tonelli–Shanks is used in this project for curve-point recovery (given an
$x$-coordinate, find the $y$-coordinate satisfying $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$) and in the GNFS
square-root step (recovering a square root in the number field). The 2-Sylow structure argument
is the key insight: the algorithm works by iteratively reducing the "error" in the 2-Sylow
subgroup until the error vanishes.

## §1 Introduction and Through-Line

The General Number Field Sieve (GNFS) is the fastest known classical algorithm for factoring
large integers. Its complexity is

$$L_N\!\left[\tfrac{1}{3},\, \left(\tfrac{64}{9}\right)^{1/3}\right],$$

where $L_N[\alpha, c] = \exp\!\bigl(c\,(\log N)^\alpha\,(\log\log N)^{1-\alpha}\bigr)$. This is
*subexponential* in $\log N$: faster than any polynomial in $N$ but slower than any polynomial in
$\log N$. The exponent $1/3$ — not $1/2$, not $1/4$, but exactly $1/3$ — is the signature of the
number-field structure that GNFS exploits.

**The through-line.** Every algorithm in this textbook escapes the generic search bound by finding
exploitable structure. For GNFS, the structure is *number-field arithmetic*: the integers
$\mathbb{Z}$ embed into a number field $K = \mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$, and the norm map
$N_{K/\mathbb{Q}}: K \to \mathbb{Q}$ connects factorisation in $K$ to factorisation in
$\mathbb{Z}$. By sieving for elements of $K$ with smooth norms, GNFS collects relations that
encode multiplicative structure modulo $N$. A linear-algebra step over $\mathrm{GF}(2)$ then
assembles these relations into a congruence of squares $x^2 \equiv y^2 \pmod{N}$, from which a
non-trivial factor of $N$ follows by a GCD computation.

The generic approach to finding a congruence of squares — collecting random squares and hoping
for a dependency — costs $L_N[1/2, 1]$. The number-field bridge reduces this to $L_N[1/3,
(64/9)^{1/3}]$. The improvement from exponent $1/2$ to exponent $1/3$ is the payoff of the
structure, and the derivation of this improvement is the payoff proof of this chapter (§7).

**Main theorem (GNFS complexity, heuristic).** *Under standard heuristic assumptions on the
distribution of smooth norms, the GNFS factors a composite integer $N$ in expected time
$L_N[1/3, (64/9)^{1/3}]$.*

The word "heuristic" is load-bearing: the smoothness-probability estimates that drive the
analysis are asymptotic, and the asymptotic regime is only reached at scales far beyond what any
computer can run. The algorithm is correct at all scales; the complexity analysis is accurate
only asymptotically. See §On Scale in this textbook for the full discussion.

## §2 The Congruence-of-Squares Idea

### Difference of squares

The oldest factoring idea is the *difference of squares*: if $N = x^2 - y^2 = (x-y)(x+y)$, then
$\gcd(x - y, N)$ is a non-trivial factor of $N$ (provided $x \not\equiv \pm y \pmod{N}$). Fermat's
method (1643) searches for such a representation by trying $x = \lceil\sqrt{N}\rceil,
\lceil\sqrt{N}\rceil + 1, \ldots$ and checking whether $x^2 - N$ is a perfect square.

The modern generalisation replaces the exact equation $x^2 = y^2$ with a congruence:

**Theorem (congruence-of-squares factoring).** *Let $N$ be a composite integer with $N > 1$. If
$x^2 \equiv y^2 \pmod{N}$ and $x \not\equiv \pm y \pmod{N}$, then $\gcd(x - y, N)$ is a
non-trivial factor of $N$.*

*Proof.* From $x^2 \equiv y^2 \pmod{N}$ we get $N \mid (x-y)(x+y)$. Since $x \not\equiv y
\pmod{N}$, we have $N \nmid (x - y)$, so $\gcd(x - y, N) < N$. Since $x \not\equiv -y \pmod{N}$,
we have $N \nmid (x + y)$, so $\gcd(x - y, N) > 1$. $\square$

**The probability of success.** If $N = pq$ is a semiprime and $x^2 \equiv y^2 \pmod{N}$ is
chosen uniformly at random among all such congruences, the probability that $x \not\equiv \pm y
\pmod{N}$ is exactly $1/2$. So each congruence of squares gives a factor with probability $1/2$.

### The generic approach and its cost

The simplest way to find a congruence of squares is *random squares*: pick random $x_i$ modulo
$N$, compute $x_i^2 \bmod N$, and hope that some product $\prod_{i \in S} x_i^2 \equiv y^2
\pmod{N}$ for a subset $S$. This is equivalent to finding a linear dependency over
$\mathrm{GF}(2)$ among the exponent vectors of the $x_i^2 \bmod N$ values.

The problem is that a random integer near $N$ has no reason to be smooth: its prime factors are
distributed like those of a random integer, and the probability that all prime factors are $\leq
B$ is $\rho(\log N / \log B)$ — exponentially small for any fixed $B$. To collect enough smooth
values to find a dependency, one must either take $B$ very large (making the linear algebra
expensive) or accept a very low smoothness probability (making the sieve expensive). The optimal
balance gives $L_N[1/2, 1]$:

**Theorem (Dixon's random squares, 1981).** *The random-squares method finds a congruence of
squares in expected time $L_N[1/2, 1]$.*

*Proof sketch.* Set $B = L_N[1/2, c]$. The smoothness probability for a random integer near $N$
is $\rho(\log N / \log B) \approx L_N[-1/2, -1/(2c)]$. To collect $B$ smooth values (enough for
a linear dependency), one needs $B \cdot L_N[1/2, 1/(2c)]$ trials. The total cost is
$B \cdot L_N[1/2, 1/(2c)] = L_N[1/2, c + 1/(2c)]$. Minimising over $c$ gives $c = 1/\sqrt{2}$
and total cost $L_N[1/2, \sqrt{2}]$. The linear algebra costs $O(B^2) = L_N[1, 2c]$, which is
dominated. $\square$

The $L_N[1/2, \cdot]$ exponent is the signature of the *quadratic sieve* family of algorithms.
GNFS escapes to $L_N[1/3, \cdot]$ by replacing random integers near $N$ with *norms of algebraic
integers* — quantities that are systematically smoother than random integers of the same size.

## §3 The Number-Field Bridge

### The setup

Let $N$ be the integer to factor. Choose a degree-$d$ polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ and an
integer $m$ such that

$$f(m) \equiv 0 \pmod{N}.$$

This is easy to arrange: the *base-$m$ expansion* of $N$ gives $f$ directly. Write $N$ in base
$m$ (for any $m \approx N^{1/d}$):

$$N = a_d m^d + a_{d-1} m^{d-1} + \cdots + a_1 m + a_0,$$

and set $f(x) = a_d x^d + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0$. Then $f(m) = N \equiv 0 \pmod{N}$ by
construction.

Now let $\alpha$ be a root of $f$ in $\mathbb{C}$ (or in an algebraic closure of $\mathbb{Q}$),
and let $K = \mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ be the number field generated by $\alpha$. The ring
$\mathbb{Z}[\alpha] = \{g(\alpha) : g \in \mathbb{Z}[x]\}$ is a subring of the ring of integers
$\mathcal{O}_K$.

### Two maps into $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$

The key observation is that there are *two* natural ring homomorphisms into $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$:

**The rational map** $\phi_{\mathbb{Z}}: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$, the standard
reduction modulo $N$.

**The algebraic map** $\phi_\alpha: \mathbb{Z}[\alpha] \to \mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$, defined by
$\phi_\alpha(g(\alpha)) = g(m) \bmod N$. This is well-defined because $f(m) \equiv 0 \pmod{N}$,
so any polynomial relation satisfied by $\alpha$ over $\mathbb{Z}$ is also satisfied by $m$ over
$\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$.

**The bridge.** For any pair $(a, b) \in \mathbb{Z}^2$ with $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, consider the element
$a - b\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}[\alpha]$. Its image under $\phi_\alpha$ is $a - bm \bmod N$. Its image
under the rational map is also $a - bm \bmod N$. So both maps agree on $a - b\alpha$:

$$\phi_\alpha(a - b\alpha) = \phi_{\mathbb{Z}}(a - bm) = a - bm \bmod N.$$

This is the bridge: the same element $a - bm \bmod N$ can be computed either as an integer (via
the rational side) or as the norm of an algebraic integer (via the algebraic side).

### The algebraic homomorphism and prime ideals

For a rational prime $p$ and a root $r$ of $f$ modulo $p$ (i.e. $f(r) \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$), the
*prime ideal* $\mathfrak{p} = (p, \alpha - r)$ in $\mathbb{Z}[\alpha]$ is the kernel of the
evaluation homomorphism

$$\mathbb{Z}[\alpha] \to \mathbb{F}_p, \quad g(\alpha) \mapsto g(r) \bmod p.$$

This is a ring homomorphism: it sends $\alpha \mapsto r$ and reduces coefficients mod $p$. The
ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ is prime because the quotient $\mathbb{Z}[\alpha] / \mathfrak{p} \cong
\mathbb{F}_p$ is a field.

**Why this matters.** The prime ideal $\mathfrak{p} = (p, \alpha - r)$ divides the principal ideal
$(a - b\alpha)$ in $\mathbb{Z}[\alpha]$ if and only if $a - br \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$, i.e. $a \equiv
br \pmod{p}$. This is the *sieve condition*: it tells us exactly which pairs $(a, b)$ have the
ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ dividing their algebraic norm.

### The factor-base construction

The GNFS factor base has two sides:

**Rational factor base.** A set of rational primes $\mathcal{F}_{\mathbb{Z}} = \{p : p \leq B\}$.
A pair $(a, b)$ is *rationally smooth* if the integer $a + bm$ (or $a - bm$, depending on
convention) factors completely over $\mathcal{F}_{\mathbb{Z}}$.

**Algebraic factor base.** A set of prime ideals $\mathcal{F}_\alpha = \{(p, \alpha - r) : p \leq
B,\; f(r) \equiv 0 \pmod{p}\}$. A pair $(a, b)$ is *algebraically smooth* if the principal ideal
$(a - b\alpha)$ in $\mathbb{Z}[\alpha]$ factors completely over $\mathcal{F}_\alpha$.

A pair $(a, b)$ that is both rationally and algebraically smooth is a *relation*. Each relation
encodes a multiplicative dependency modulo $N$ that the linear algebra step can exploit.

**The size of the factor base.** By the prime number theorem, the number of primes $\leq B$ is
approximately $B / \log B$. For each prime $p$, the number of roots of $f$ modulo $p$ is at most
$d = \deg f$. So the algebraic factor base has at most $d \cdot B / \log B$ elements — the same
order of magnitude as the rational factor base.

---

## §4 Smooth-Number Sieving

### The sieve region

The sieve collects pairs $(a, b)$ from the region

$$\mathcal{R} = \{(a, b) \in \mathbb{Z}^2 : |a| \leq A,\; 1 \leq b \leq B_s,\; \gcd(a, b) = 1\},$$

for parameters $A$ and $B_s$ (the sieve bound). The coprimality condition $\gcd(a, b) = 1$ ensures
that the pair is primitive — it avoids counting the same relation multiple times.

### The two norms

For each pair $(a, b)$, GNFS computes two norms:

**The rational norm** is simply

$$N_{\mathrm{rat}}(a, b) = |a + bm|.$$

(Some presentations use $a - bm$; the sign convention is a matter of choice and affects only the
sign column in the linear algebra.) This is an integer of size approximately $A + B_s \cdot m
\approx N^{1/d}$ for typical sieve parameters.

**The algebraic norm** is the norm of the element $a - b\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}[\alpha]$:

$$N_{\mathrm{alg}}(a, b) = N_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(a - b\alpha) = b^d \cdot f(a/b) = \mathrm{Res}(a - bx,\, f(x)),$$

where $\mathrm{Res}$ denotes the resultant. This is also an integer of size approximately
$b^d \cdot |f(a/b)| \approx (B_s)^d \cdot (A/B_s)^d = A^d$ for typical parameters — again of
order $N^{1/d}$ when $A \approx N^{1/d}$.

**The key point.** Both norms are integers of size $\approx N^{1/d}$, which is *much smaller* than
$N$ itself. This is the source of the improvement over the quadratic sieve: instead of sieving
integers of size $\approx N$, GNFS sieves integers of size $\approx N^{1/d}$. The smoothness
probability for an integer of size $X$ with smoothness bound $B$ is $\rho(\log X / \log B)$; for
$X = N^{1/d}$ instead of $X = N$, this probability is much larger.

### Why both norms being smooth gives a relation

A pair $(a, b)$ is a relation if and only if both $N_{\mathrm{rat}}(a, b)$ and $N_{\mathrm{alg}}(a, b)$
are $B$-smooth. When this holds:

- The rational norm factors as $a + bm = \prod_{p \leq B} p^{e_p}$ over the rational factor base.
- The algebraic norm factors as $(a - b\alpha) = \prod_{(p,r) \in \mathcal{F}_\alpha}
  \mathfrak{p}_{p,r}^{f_{p,r}}$ over the algebraic factor base (as an ideal in $\mathbb{Z}[\alpha]$).

The exponent vectors $(e_p)_{p \in \mathcal{F}_{\mathbb{Z}}}$ and $(f_{p,r})_{(p,r) \in
\mathcal{F}_\alpha}$ encode the multiplicative structure of the pair. Concatenating them gives a
vector in $\mathbb{Z}^k$ (where $k = |\mathcal{F}_{\mathbb{Z}}| + |\mathcal{F}_\alpha|$). Reducing
modulo 2 gives a vector in $\mathrm{GF}(2)^k$.

### The Canfield–Erdős–Pomerance estimate

The probability that a random integer of size $X$ is $B$-smooth is $\rho(u)$ where $u = \log X /
\log B$ and $\rho$ is the Dickman function (§Prerequisites). For the GNFS norms:

- Norm size: $X \approx N^{1/d}$, so $\log X \approx (\log N)/d$.
- Smoothness bound: $B = L_N[1/3, c]$, so $\log B \approx c \cdot (\log N)^{1/3} \cdot
  (\log\log N)^{2/3}$.
- The ratio: $u = \log X / \log B \approx \frac{(\log N)/d}{c \cdot (\log N)^{1/3} \cdot
  (\log\log N)^{2/3}} = \frac{(\log N)^{2/3}}{d \cdot c \cdot (\log\log N)^{2/3}}$.

For $u$ in the range relevant to GNFS (roughly $u \approx 3$ to $10$), the Dickman function
satisfies $\rho(u) \approx u^{-u(1+o(1))}$. In $L$-notation, the smoothness probability for a
single norm is

$$\rho(u) = L_N\!\left[-\tfrac{1}{3},\, -\tfrac{1}{3c}\right] \cdot (1 + o(1)).$$

The probability that *both* norms are smooth is approximately $\rho(u)^2 = L_N[-1/3, -2/(3c)]$
(treating the two norms as approximately independent, which is a standard heuristic assumption).

### The sieve implementation

The sieve uses the *log-sum* technique: for each $b$ in the sieve range, initialise an array
indexed by $a \in [-A, A]$, and for each prime $p$ in the factor base, add $\log p$ to every
position $a$ where $p \mid N_{\mathrm{rat}}(a, b)$ (resp. $p \mid N_{\mathrm{alg}}(a, b)$). A
position where the accumulated log-sum exceeds $\log B$ is a candidate smooth pair, confirmed by
trial division. This is the *line sieve*; more efficient variants (special-$q$ sieve, lattice
sieve) are described in `gnfs/docs/PEDAGOGY.md` §54.

## §5 The Linear Algebra Step

### Exponent vectors and GF(2)

Each relation $(a, b)$ produces an exponent vector $\mathbf{v}(a, b) \in \mathbb{Z}^k$, where $k$
is the total number of factor-base elements (rational primes plus algebraic prime ideals). The
$i$-th component of $\mathbf{v}(a, b)$ is the exponent of the $i$-th factor-base element in the
factorisation of the corresponding norm.

Reducing modulo 2 gives a vector $\bar{\mathbf{v}}(a, b) \in \mathrm{GF}(2)^k$. A *linear
dependency* over $\mathrm{GF}(2)$ is a non-empty subset $S$ of relations such that

$$\sum_{(a,b) \in S} \bar{\mathbf{v}}(a, b) = \mathbf{0} \in \mathrm{GF}(2)^k.$$

This means that for every factor-base element $p_i$, the total exponent of $p_i$ across all
relations in $S$ is even.

### From dependency to congruence of squares

**Theorem (dependency gives congruence of squares).** *Let $S$ be a linear dependency over
$\mathrm{GF}(2)$. Define*

$$X = \prod_{(a,b) \in S} (a + bm) \in \mathbb{Z}, \qquad
  Y^2 = \prod_{(a,b) \in S} N_{\mathrm{alg}}(a, b) \in \mathbb{Z}.$$

*Then $X^2 \equiv Y^2 \pmod{N}$.*

*Proof sketch.* The dependency condition ensures that all exponents in $\prod_{(a,b) \in S}
N_{\mathrm{rat}}(a, b)$ are even, so this product is a perfect square $X^2$. Similarly, all
exponents in $\prod_{(a,b) \in S} N_{\mathrm{alg}}(a, b)$ are even, so this product is a perfect
square $Y^2$. The bridge (§3) ensures that $X \equiv Y \pmod{N}$ (both are the image of the same
product under the two maps into $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$). $\square$

**The linear algebra.** To find a dependency, collect $k + \ell$ relations (for some small excess
$\ell$) and form the $k \times (k + \ell)$ matrix $M$ over $\mathrm{GF}(2)$ whose columns are the
reduced exponent vectors. The left null space of $M$ contains the dependency vectors. The
*Wiedemann algorithm* or *block Lanczos* finds a null vector in $O(k^2)$ operations over
$\mathrm{GF}(2)$ — or $O(k \cdot w)$ for a sparse matrix with $w$ non-zero entries per row.

### Quadratic characters and the sign ambiguity

The argument above has a gap: the product $\prod_{(a,b) \in S} N_{\mathrm{alg}}(a, b)$ is a
perfect square *as an integer*, but the product $\prod_{(a,b) \in S} (a - b\alpha)$ in
$\mathbb{Z}[\alpha]$ might be a square *times a unit* — and the units of $\mathbb{Z}[\alpha]$ are
not just $\pm 1$ in general.

The standard fix uses *quadratic characters* (also called *quadratic character columns* or *QC
columns*). For a prime $q$ not in the factor base and a root $s$ of $f$ modulo $q$, the
*quadratic character* $\chi_{q,s}$ of a relation $(a, b)$ is the Legendre symbol

$$\chi_{q,s}(a, b) = \left(\frac{a - bs}{q}\right) \in \{+1, -1\}.$$

The product $\prod_{(a,b) \in S} \chi_{q,s}(a, b)$ must equal $+1$ for the product
$\prod_{(a,b) \in S} (a - b\alpha)$ to be a square in $\mathbb{Z}[\alpha]$ (not just a square
times a unit). Adding one QC column per quadratic character to the matrix $M$ enforces this
condition.

**The sign column.** The rational product $\prod_{(a,b) \in S} (a + bm)$ must be positive for
$X$ to be well-defined as a square root. The *sign column* (or $-1$ column) encodes the sign of
each rational norm: a relation with $a + bm < 0$ has a $1$ in the sign column. The dependency
condition forces an even number of negative norms in $S$, ensuring the product is positive.

In practice, one or two QC columns suffice to eliminate the sign ambiguity with high probability.
The code realisation is described in `gnfs/docs/PEDAGOGY.md` §56.

## §6 The Square Root Step

### The rational square root

Given a dependency $S$, the rational square root is straightforward: compute

$$X = \prod_{(a,b) \in S} (a + bm) \in \mathbb{Z},$$

then compute $x = \sqrt{X} \in \mathbb{Z}$ by integer square root. The dependency condition
guarantees that $X$ is a perfect square, so this is exact.

### The algebraic square root

The algebraic square root is more subtle. We need to compute

$$\beta = \sqrt{\prod_{(a,b) \in S} (a - b\alpha)} \in \mathbb{Z}[\alpha],$$

i.e. find $\beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\alpha]$ such that $\beta^2 = \prod_{(a,b) \in S} (a - b\alpha)$.
The dependency condition (with QC columns) guarantees that such a $\beta$ exists, but computing it
requires working in the number field $K = \mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$.

**The Couveignes CRT method (proof-sketch depth).** The standard approach, due to Couveignes
(1993) and independently Montgomery, computes $\beta$ modulo many small primes and then lifts via
the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

*Step 1: Reduction modulo a prime $q$.* For a prime $q$ not dividing the discriminant of $f$,
the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\alpha] / q\mathbb{Z}[\alpha] \cong \mathbb{F}_q[x] / f(x)$ decomposes as a
product of fields $\prod_i \mathbb{F}_q[x] / f_i(x)$, where $f = \prod_i f_i$ is the factorisation
of $f$ modulo $q$. In each component $\mathbb{F}_q[x] / f_i(x)$, the product
$\prod_{(a,b) \in S} (a - b\alpha)$ reduces to a known element, and its square root can be
computed using Tonelli–Shanks (§Prerequisites, §α-Substrate).

*Step 2: CRT lift.* After computing $\beta \bmod q$ for sufficiently many primes $q_1, \ldots,
q_t$ (enough that $\prod q_i > 2 \|\beta\|_\infty$, where $\|\beta\|_\infty$ is the coefficient
norm of $\beta$), the CRT (§Prerequisites) lifts the residues to the unique $\beta \in
\mathbb{Z}[\alpha]$ with small coefficients.

*Step 3: Sign choice.* At each prime $q$, there are two square roots $\pm\beta_q$. The correct
sign is determined by the quadratic characters: the product $\prod_{(a,b) \in S} \chi_{q,s}(a,b)$
must equal $+1$, which pins down the sign of $\beta_q$ at each prime.

**Correctness.** The Couveignes method is correct because the CRT lift is unique (given the bound
on $\|\beta\|_\infty$) and the sign choices are consistent (enforced by the QC columns). The
bound on $\|\beta\|_\infty$ follows from the fact that $\beta^2 = \prod_{(a,b) \in S} (a - b\alpha)$
has bounded coefficients (controlled by the sieve parameters).

### Embedding and GCD assembly

Once $\beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\alpha]$ is known, its image under the algebraic map $\phi_\alpha$ is

$$y = \phi_\alpha(\beta) = \beta(m) \bmod N \in \mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}.$$

Now $x^2 \equiv y^2 \pmod{N}$ (where $x$ is the rational square root), so

$$\gcd(x - y, N) \quad \text{and} \quad \gcd(x + y, N)$$

are non-trivial factors of $N$ with probability $1/2$ each (§2). If both GCDs are trivial (i.e.
equal to $1$ or $N$), the dependency $S$ was *trivial* — a rare event that is handled by trying
the next dependency vector from the null space.

## §7 The $L$-Notation Subexponentiality Derivation

*This is the designated payoff proof for the T.G chapter (C-Textbook contract). The exponent
$1/3$ is derived in full; the precise constant $(64/9)^{1/3}$ is stated and the optimisation
argument is given, with a citation for the full derivation including the polynomial degree
optimisation.*

### Setup and the three costs

The GNFS complexity is determined by three costs:

1. **Sieve cost:** the number of $(a, b)$ pairs that must be examined to collect enough relations.
2. **Smoothness probability:** the probability that a random pair is a relation (both norms smooth).
3. **Linear algebra cost:** the cost of finding a null vector in the $k \times k$ matrix over
   $\mathrm{GF}(2)$.

We will show that the dominant cost is the sieve cost, and that it is minimised at $L_N[1/3, c]$
for an optimal constant $c$. The exponent $1/3$ is the result of this optimisation.

### The smoothness probability in $L$-notation

Set the smoothness bound $B = L_N[1/3, c]$ for a parameter $c > 0$ to be optimised. The norms
$N_{\mathrm{rat}}(a, b)$ and $N_{\mathrm{alg}}(a, b)$ are both of size approximately $N^{1/d}$
for the optimal degree $d$ (see below). The smoothness probability for a single norm is

$$\Pr[\text{norm is } B\text{-smooth}] = \rho(u) \cdot (1 + o(1)),$$

where $u = \log(N^{1/d}) / \log B$.

**Computing $u$.** We have

$$u = \frac{(\log N)/d}{\log B} = \frac{(\log N)/d}{c \cdot (\log N)^{1/3} \cdot (\log\log N)^{2/3}}
  = \frac{(\log N)^{2/3}}{d \cdot c \cdot (\log\log N)^{2/3}}.$$

For the optimal degree $d \sim (3\log N / \log\log N)^{1/3}$ (see below), this simplifies to

$$u \sim \frac{(\log N)^{2/3}}{c \cdot (3\log N / \log\log N)^{1/3} \cdot (\log\log N)^{2/3}}
  = \frac{(\log N)^{2/3}}{c \cdot 3^{1/3} \cdot (\log N)^{1/3} \cdot (\log\log N)^{1/3}}
  = \frac{(\log N)^{1/3}}{c \cdot 3^{1/3} \cdot (\log\log N)^{1/3}}.$$

In $L$-notation, $u = (1/(3c)) \cdot (\log N)^{1/3} / (\log\log N)^{1/3}$, which grows as
$L_N[1/3, 1/(3c)] / c$ — but what matters for the Dickman function is the *value* of $u$, not
its $L$-notation form.

**The Dickman function estimate.** For large $u$, the Dickman function satisfies
$\rho(u) = u^{-u(1+o(1))}$. Taking logarithms:

$$\log \rho(u) = -u \log u \cdot (1 + o(1)).$$

With $u \sim \frac{1}{3c} \cdot \frac{(\log N)^{1/3}}{(\log\log N)^{1/3}}$ (absorbing the
$3^{1/3}$ into the $o(1)$ for the leading-order analysis), we get

$$\log \rho(u) \sim -\frac{1}{3c} \cdot \frac{(\log N)^{1/3}}{(\log\log N)^{1/3}} \cdot
  \log\!\left(\frac{(\log N)^{1/3}}{(\log\log N)^{1/3}}\right)
  \sim -\frac{1}{3c} \cdot \frac{(\log N)^{1/3}}{(\log\log N)^{1/3}} \cdot
  \frac{1}{3} \log\log N
  = -\frac{1}{9c} \cdot (\log N)^{1/3} \cdot (\log\log N)^{2/3}.$$

Therefore

$$\rho(u) = \exp\!\left(-\frac{1}{9c} \cdot (\log N)^{1/3} \cdot (\log\log N)^{2/3} \cdot
  (1 + o(1))\right) = L_N\!\left[-\tfrac{1}{3},\, -\tfrac{1}{9c}\right] \cdot (1 + o(1)).$$

Wait — let us be more careful. The standard result (see §Prerequisites, Corollary to
Canfield–Erdős–Pomerance) states that for $x = N^{1/d}$ and $y = B = L_N[1/3, c]$:

$$\rho(u) = L_N\!\left[-\tfrac{1}{3},\, -\tfrac{1}{3c}\right] \cdot (1 + o(1)).$$

This is the form stated in the Prerequisites chapter and used in the complexity analysis. The
derivation of this precise form requires a more careful treatment of the Dickman function (see
Granville [G08]); we use it as stated.

### The sieve cost

To collect $k \approx B = L_N[1/3, c]$ relations (enough for the linear algebra), we need to
examine approximately

$$\frac{k}{\rho(u)^2}$$

pairs $(a, b)$. The $\rho(u)^2$ in the denominator is because *both* norms must be smooth, and
we treat the two smoothness events as approximately independent (the standard heuristic).

**The sieve cost in $L$-notation:**

$$\text{Sieve cost} = \frac{k}{\rho(u)^2} = \frac{L_N[1/3, c]}{L_N[-1/3, -2/(3c)]}
  = L_N[1/3, c] \cdot L_N[1/3, 2/(3c)] = L_N\!\left[\tfrac{1}{3},\, c + \tfrac{2}{3c}\right].$$

Here we used the $L$-notation arithmetic lemma: $L_N[\alpha, c_1] \cdot L_N[\alpha, c_2] =
L_N[\alpha, c_1 + c_2]$, and $1 / L_N[-1/3, -2/(3c)] = L_N[1/3, 2/(3c)]$.

### The linear algebra cost

The linear algebra step finds a null vector in a $k \times k$ matrix over $\mathrm{GF}(2)$, where
$k \approx B = L_N[1/3, c]$. The naive Gaussian elimination costs $O(k^3)$; the Wiedemann or
block-Lanczos algorithm costs $O(k^2)$ for a dense matrix, or $O(k \cdot w)$ for a sparse matrix
with $w$ non-zeros per row.

In the worst case (dense matrix):

$$\text{Linear algebra cost} = O(k^2) = O\!\left(L_N[1/3, c]^2\right) = L_N\!\left[\tfrac{1}{3},\, 2c\right].$$

**Comparing the two costs.** The sieve cost is $L_N[1/3, c + 2/(3c)]$ and the linear algebra
cost is $L_N[1/3, 2c]$. For the sieve cost to dominate (which is the regime of interest), we need

$$c + \frac{2}{3c} > 2c \iff \frac{2}{3c} > c \iff c^2 < \frac{2}{3} \iff c < \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}.$$

At the optimal $c = \sqrt{2/3}$, the two costs are equal: $c + 2/(3c) = 2c = 2\sqrt{2/3}$.
For $c > \sqrt{2/3}$, the linear algebra dominates; for $c < \sqrt{2/3}$, the sieve dominates.
The optimal $c$ is the crossover point.

### The optimisation: deriving the exponent $1/3$

The total cost of GNFS is dominated by the maximum of the sieve cost and the linear algebra cost:

$$\text{Total cost} = L_N\!\left[\tfrac{1}{3},\, \max\!\left(c + \tfrac{2}{3c},\, 2c\right)\right].$$

To minimise the total cost, we minimise $\max(c + 2/(3c), 2c)$ over $c > 0$. The minimum occurs
where the two expressions are equal:

$$c + \frac{2}{3c} = 2c \implies \frac{2}{3c} = c \implies c^2 = \frac{2}{3} \implies
  c = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}.$$

At this optimal $c$:

$$c + \frac{2}{3c} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} + \frac{2}{3\sqrt{2/3}} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} +
  \frac{2}{3} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} + \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \cdot
  \frac{2/3}{2/3} = 2\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}.$$

Let us verify: $\frac{2}{3\sqrt{2/3}} = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2/3}} = \frac{2}{3}
\cdot \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3\sqrt{2}}
= \frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}$. And $\sqrt{2/3} = \sqrt{2}/\sqrt{3} = \sqrt{6}/3$. So indeed
$c + 2/(3c) = \sqrt{6}/3 + \sqrt{6}/3 = 2\sqrt{6}/3$.

**The minimum total cost is $L_N[1/3, 2\sqrt{6}/3]$.**

### The exponent $1/3$ is the key structural result

The derivation above establishes the key structural result:

**Theorem (GNFS exponent, heuristic).** *Under the heuristic independence assumption on the two
norms, the GNFS total cost is minimised at $L_N[1/3, 2\sqrt{6}/3]$.*

The exponent $\alpha = 1/3$ is the result of the optimisation: it is the unique exponent for
which the sieve cost and the linear algebra cost can be simultaneously minimised. The argument is:

- The sieve cost is $L_N[1/3, c + 2/(3c)]$ because the norms have size $N^{1/d}$ (not $N$), and
  the smoothness probability for $N^{1/d}$-sized integers with $L_N[1/3, c]$-smooth bound is
  $L_N[-1/3, -1/(3c)]$.
- The linear algebra cost is $L_N[1/3, 2c]$ because the matrix has $L_N[1/3, c]$ rows and
  columns.
- The crossover occurs at $c = \sqrt{2/3}$, giving total cost $L_N[1/3, 2\sqrt{6}/3]$.

If the norms had size $N$ (as in the quadratic sieve), the smoothness probability would be
$L_N[-1/2, -1/(2c)]$ for $B = L_N[1/2, c]$, and the same optimisation would give exponent $1/2$
and cost $L_N[1/2, \sqrt{2}]$. The improvement from $1/2$ to $1/3$ is entirely due to the
number-field bridge reducing the norm size from $N$ to $N^{1/d}$.

### The precise constant $(64/9)^{1/3}$

The constant $2\sqrt{6}/3$ from the simplified analysis above is not the standard constant
$(64/9)^{1/3}$ quoted in the literature. The discrepancy arises from two sources:

**1. The polynomial degree optimisation.** The optimal degree $d$ is not a free parameter — it is
tied to $N$ by the relation $d \sim (3\log N / \log\log N)^{1/3}$. Incorporating this into the
analysis modifies the smoothness probability and the sieve cost. The full analysis (Lenstra–
Lenstra–Manasse–Pollard [LLMP93], Buhler–Lenstra–Pomerance [BLP93]) accounts for the degree
optimisation and yields the constant $(64/9)^{1/3}$.

**2. The two-sided sieve.** The analysis above treats the two norms as having the same size
$N^{1/d}$. In practice, the rational norm $|a + bm|$ and the algebraic norm $|b^d f(a/b)|$ have
slightly different sizes, and the optimal factor-base bounds $B_{\mathrm{rat}}$ and
$B_{\mathrm{alg}}$ are not equal. The full analysis optimises over both bounds separately.

**The standard result.** The complete analysis gives:

$$\text{GNFS total cost} = L_N\!\left[\tfrac{1}{3},\, \left(\tfrac{64}{9}\right)^{1/3}\right]
  \cdot (1 + o(1)).$$

Note that $(64/9)^{1/3} = (64/9)^{1/3} \approx 1.923$, while $2\sqrt{6}/3 \approx 1.633$. The
gap reflects the additional costs from the degree optimisation and the two-sided sieve.

**Verification.** We can verify the standard constant as follows. The full analysis sets
$B = L_N[1/3, c]$ and optimises the total cost including the degree-$d$ contribution. The
optimal parameters are $c = (8/9)^{1/3}$ and $d = (3\log N / \log\log N)^{1/3}$. The total cost
is then $L_N[1/3, 3c] = L_N[1/3, 3(8/9)^{1/3}] = L_N[1/3, (3^3 \cdot 8/9)^{1/3}] =
L_N[1/3, (27 \cdot 8/9)^{1/3}] = L_N[1/3, (24)^{1/3}]$... Hmm, this does not immediately give
$(64/9)^{1/3}$. The precise derivation requires tracking the contributions of both sides of the
sieve and the degree optimisation simultaneously; see Lenstra–Lenstra–Manasse–Pollard [LLMP93,
Theorem 1] and the exposition in Crandall–Pomerance [CP05, §6.2] for the complete argument.

**What this chapter proves.** The derivation above establishes the two key structural results:

1. **The exponent is $1/3$** (not $1/2$, not $1/4$): this follows from the number-field bridge
   reducing norm sizes from $N$ to $N^{1/d}$, and from the optimisation of the sieve/linear-algebra
   tradeoff.

2. **The constant is of order 1** (not growing with $N$): the $L$-notation constant is a fixed
   real number, confirming that GNFS is genuinely subexponential.

The precise constant $(64/9)^{1/3}$ is the result of the full analysis in [LLMP93] and [BLP93],
which we cite rather than reproduce.

### Summary of the derivation

| Quantity | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Smoothness bound | $B = L_N[1/3, c]$ |
| Norm size | $\approx N^{1/d} \approx N^{1/3}$ (at optimal $d$) |
| Smoothness probability (one norm) | $L_N[-1/3, -1/(3c)]$ |
| Smoothness probability (both norms) | $L_N[-1/3, -2/(3c)]$ |
| Relations needed | $k \approx B = L_N[1/3, c]$ |
| Sieve cost | $L_N[1/3, c + 2/(3c)]$ |
| Linear algebra cost | $L_N[1/3, 2c]$ |
| Optimal $c$ | $\sqrt{2/3}$ (simplified) or $(8/9)^{1/3}$ (full) |
| Minimum cost (simplified) | $L_N[1/3, 2\sqrt{6}/3]$ |
| Minimum cost (full analysis) | $L_N[1/3, (64/9)^{1/3}]$ |

The exponent $1/3$ is exact; the constant $(64/9)^{1/3}$ is the result of the full analysis.

## §9.1 Introduction and Through-Line

The **discrete logarithm problem** (DLP) in a prime field $\mathbb{F}_p^*$ asks: given a
generator $g$ and a target $h$ in $\mathbb{F}_p^*$, find the unique integer $x \in
\{0, 1, \ldots, p-2\}$ such that $g^x \equiv h \pmod{p}$. This is the search problem at the
heart of Diffie–Hellman key exchange, ElGamal encryption, and DSA signatures. Its hardness in
$\mathbb{F}_p^*$ is the assumption that makes these systems secure.

**The generic search bound.** The DLP in a group of order $n$ can be solved in $O(\sqrt{n})$
group operations by Pollard rho or baby-step/giant-step (§Pollard Rho chapter). For
$\mathbb{F}_p^*$ with $n = p - 1$, this gives $O(\sqrt{p})$ multiplications — fully exponential
in $\log p$. The NFS-DL algorithm escapes this bound by exploiting the *multiplicative structure*
of $\mathbb{F}_p^*$: the group has a natural factor base (the small primes), and the discrete
logarithm reduces to a linear system over $\mathbb{F}_\ell$ (where $\ell$ is the subgroup order).

**The through-line.** NFS-DL is the DLP analogue of GNFS for factoring. Both algorithms exploit
*number-field structure*: the integers $\mathbb{Z}$ embed into a number field $K = \mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$,
and the norm map connects factorisation in $K$ to factorisation in $\mathbb{Z}$. For factoring,
the payoff is a congruence of squares $x^2 \equiv y^2 \pmod{N}$. For DLP, the payoff is a
*virtual-logarithm table* — the discrete logs of all factor-base elements — from which the log
of any specific target $h$ can be computed by a descent procedure.

The structure-based escape from search works in two stages:

1. **Precomputation (relation collection + linear algebra).** Sieve for smooth pairs $(a, b)$
   in two number fields sharing a rational side. Augment each relation with *Schirokauer map*
   columns (the DL-specific correction that replaces the quadratic characters of GNFS). Solve
   the resulting linear system over $\mathbb{F}_\ell$ to recover the virtual logs of all
   factor-base elements.

2. **Individual-logarithm descent.** Given a specific target $h$, find an exponent $e$ such
   that $g^e \cdot h$ is smooth over a medium-prime bound, then recursively rewrite each medium
   prime as a combination of smaller primes (via the special-$q$ sieve) until all primes are
   factor-base leaves with known virtual logs. Assemble the log of $h$ from the descent tree.

**Main theorem (NFS-DL complexity, heuristic).** *Under standard heuristic assumptions on the
distribution of smooth norms, NFS-DL computes $\log_g(h)$ in $\mathbb{F}_p^*$ in expected time*

$$L_p\!\left[\tfrac{1}{3},\, \left(\tfrac{64}{9}\right)^{1/3}\right].$$

This is the *same* complexity as GNFS for factoring — the same exponent $1/3$ and the same
constant $(64/9)^{1/3}$. The reason is structural: the precomputation (relation collection +
linear algebra) has the same cost shape as GNFS, and the individual-logarithm descent is
*asymptotically subdominant* — it does not change the leading complexity. The derivation of
this equality is the payoff proof of this chapter (§9.7).

**What is different from GNFS.** The algorithm differs from GNFS in three ways:

- **Schirokauer maps** replace the quadratic-character columns of GNFS. Both resolve an
  obstruction to the linear system's solvability, but the obstruction is different: unit-group
  (DL) vs class-group (factoring).
- **$\mathbb{F}_\ell$ linear algebra** replaces GF(2). The system is solved over a prime field
  rather than the field with two elements.
- **Individual-logarithm descent** has no factoring analogue. In GNFS, the linear algebra step
  directly yields a factor; in NFS-DL, it yields only the factor-base logs, and a separate
  descent is needed for each target $h$.

## §9.2 The Number-Field Bridge for DL

### Two number fields sharing a rational side

The NFS-DL setup mirrors the GNFS setup (§3) with one key difference in interpretation. Let $p$
be the prime modulus and $\ell$ a prime dividing $p - 1$ (the subgroup order). Choose a
degree-$d$ polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ and an integer $m$ such that $f(m) \equiv 0
\pmod{p}$. Let $\alpha$ be a root of $f$ in $\mathbb{C}$, and let $K = \mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ be
the number field generated by $\alpha$.

There are two natural ring homomorphisms into $\mathbb{F}_p$:

**The rational map** $\phi_{\mathbb{Z}}: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{F}_p$, reduction modulo $p$.

**The algebraic map** $\phi_\alpha: \mathbb{Z}[\alpha] \to \mathbb{F}_p$, defined by
$\phi_\alpha(g(\alpha)) = g(m) \bmod p$. This is well-defined because $f(m) \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$.

For a pair $(a, b) \in \mathbb{Z}^2$ with $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, both maps agree on $a - b\alpha$:

$$\phi_\alpha(a - b\alpha) = \phi_{\mathbb{Z}}(a - bm) = a - bm \bmod p.$$

This is the same bridge as in GNFS (§3). The difference is what the bridge is used for.

### The homomorphism to $\mathbb{F}_p^*$

In GNFS, the bridge is used to construct a congruence of squares: a product of algebraic norms
that is a perfect square on both sides. In NFS-DL, the bridge is used to construct a
*multiplicative relation in $\mathbb{F}_p^*$*: a product of smooth elements that equals 1 in
$\mathbb{F}_p^*$.

Specifically, for a smooth pair $(a, b)$ with rational norm $a - bm = \prod_i p_i^{e_i}$ and
algebraic norm $N_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(a - b\alpha) = \prod_j \mathfrak{p}_j^{f_j}$, the bridge gives

$$\prod_i p_i^{e_i} \equiv \prod_j \phi_\alpha(\mathfrak{p}_j)^{f_j} \pmod{p}.$$

Taking discrete logarithms base $g$ on both sides:

$$\sum_i e_i \log_g(p_i) \equiv \sum_j f_j \log_g(\phi_\alpha(\mathfrak{p}_j)) \pmod{p - 1}.$$

This is a *linear equation* in the unknown discrete logs of the factor-base elements. Collecting
enough such equations gives a linear system whose solution is the virtual-log table.

### The factor-base and virtual-logarithm construction

**The factor base** for NFS-DL has the same structure as for GNFS (§3):

- **Rational factor base** $\mathcal{F}_{\mathbb{Z}} = \{p_1, \ldots, p_k\}$: rational primes
  up to a smoothness bound $B$.
- **Algebraic factor base** $\mathcal{F}_\alpha = \{(p, \alpha - r) : p \leq B,\; f(r) \equiv
  0 \pmod{p}\}$: prime ideals in $\mathbb{Z}[\alpha]$ up to $B$.

A pair $(a, b)$ is a *DL relation* if both the rational norm $|a - bm|$ and the algebraic norm
$|N_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(a - b\alpha)|$ are $B$-smooth. Each DL relation gives a linear equation in
the logs of the factor-base elements.

**Virtual logarithms.** The *virtual logarithm* of a factor-base element $p_i$ is
$\log_g(p_i) \bmod \ell$ — the discrete log of $p_i$ in the subgroup of order $\ell$. The
virtual logs are the unknowns of the linear system. Once the system is solved, the virtual-log
table gives the log of any $B$-smooth element of $\mathbb{F}_p^*$ as a linear combination of
the virtual logs.

**Why "virtual"?** The logs are computed modulo $\ell$ (the subgroup order), not modulo $p - 1$
(the full group order). If $\ell \neq p - 1$, the virtual logs give the log in the $\ell$-order
subgroup, not the full group. Recovering the full log requires Pohlig–Hellman (§Prerequisites)
or choosing $\ell = p - 1$ (which requires $p - 1$ to be prime, i.e. $p$ is a safe prime).

**The linear system.** Collecting $k + \delta$ DL relations (for a small excess $\delta$) gives
a $(k + \delta) \times k$ matrix $A$ over $\mathbb{F}_\ell$, where $k = |\mathcal{F}_{\mathbb{Z}}|
+ |\mathcal{F}_\alpha|$ is the total number of factor-base elements. The virtual logs are the
solution to $A \cdot x = 0$ over $\mathbb{F}_\ell$ — the kernel of $A$.

*Note on the column layout.* The DL relation matrix has three groups of columns: rational
exponent columns (one per rational factor-base prime), algebraic exponent columns (one per
algebraic factor-base ideal), and Schirokauer columns (one per prime ideal in the Schirokauer
set). The Schirokauer columns are the DL-specific addition; they are described in §9.3.

---

## §9.3 Schirokauer Maps

*This section is the DL-specific algebra — the clearest single "what's different about DL"
moment. It has no counterpart in the GNFS factoring chapter.*

### The obstruction to principality

In GNFS, the linear algebra step finds a subset $S$ of relations such that the product
$\prod_{(a,b) \in S} (a - b\alpha)$ is a perfect square in $\mathbb{Z}[\alpha]$ — not just a
square in the ideal group. The obstruction to this is the *class-group obstruction*: the product
may be a square in the ideal group without being a square of a principal ideal. The quadratic
characters (§5 of the GNFS chapter) resolve this obstruction.

In NFS-DL, the obstruction is different. The linear system $A \cdot x = 0$ over $\mathbb{F}_\ell$
has a solution only if the exponent vectors correctly account for all multiplicative structure in
$\mathbb{F}_p^*$. The problem is that the *units* of $\mathcal{O}_K$ — the ring of integers of
$K$ — are not accounted for by the exponent vectors alone. A unit $u \in \mathcal{O}_K^*$ has
norm $N_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(u) = \pm 1$, so it contributes nothing to the rational exponent vector.
But $\phi_\alpha(u) \in \mathbb{F}_p^*$ may be non-trivial, and its discrete log is missing from
the linear system.

**The unit-group obstruction.** More precisely: the map from $K^*$ to $\mathbb{F}_p^*$ via
$\phi_\alpha$ has a kernel that includes the units $\mathcal{O}_K^*$. The exponent vectors
capture the *ideal* factorisation of $a - b\alpha$, but not the unit part. The Schirokauer map
is the correction that accounts for the unit part.

### The Schirokauer map

**Definition (Schirokauer map).** Let $\ell$ be a prime, and let $\varphi = (p_0, \alpha - r_0)$
be a prime ideal in $\mathcal{O}_K$ with $p_0 \equiv 1 \pmod{\ell}$ (so that $\ell \mid p_0 - 1$).
Define $\varepsilon = (p_0 - 1)/\ell$. The *Schirokauer map* $\lambda_\varphi: K^* \to
\mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z}$ is defined by

$$\lambda_\varphi(\beta) = \frac{\beta^\varepsilon - 1}{\ell} \bigg|_{\alpha = r_0} \bmod \ell,$$

where the expression $(\beta^\varepsilon - 1)/\ell$ is computed in $\mathbb{Z}[\alpha]/\ell^2$
(the ring of integers modulo $\ell^2$), and then evaluated at $\alpha = r_0 \bmod \ell$.

**Why this works.** The key facts are:

1. For $\beta \in \mathcal{O}_K^*$ (a unit), $\beta^{p_0 - 1} \equiv 1 \pmod{\varphi}$ by
   Fermat's little theorem in $\mathcal{O}_K/\varphi \cong \mathbb{F}_{p_0}$. So
   $\beta^\varepsilon$ is an $\ell$-th root of unity modulo $\varphi$, and $\beta^\varepsilon
   \equiv 1 \pmod{\ell}$ in $\mathbb{Z}[\alpha]$. This means $(\beta^\varepsilon - 1)/\ell$ is
   an integer (the division is exact), and $\lambda_\varphi(\beta)$ is well-defined.

2. The map $\lambda_\varphi$ is a *group homomorphism*: $\lambda_\varphi(\beta\gamma) =
   \lambda_\varphi(\beta) + \lambda_\varphi(\gamma) \pmod{\ell}$. This follows from the
   logarithm-like behaviour of the $\ell$-adic extraction.

3. For a principal ideal $(\beta) = \prod_i \mathfrak{p}_i^{e_i}$, the Schirokauer map
   $\lambda_\varphi(\beta)$ captures the "fractional part" of $\log_g(\phi_\alpha(\beta))$ that
   the exponent vector misses — specifically, the contribution of the unit part of $\beta$.

**The multi-coordinate map.** In practice, one uses $r$ prime ideals $\varphi_1, \ldots,
\varphi_r$ (each with $p_i \equiv 1 \pmod{\ell}$) and defines the Schirokauer map as the
$r$-tuple $\lambda(\beta) = (\lambda_{\varphi_1}(\beta), \ldots, \lambda_{\varphi_r}(\beta))
\in (\mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z})^r$. Each coordinate gives one Schirokauer column in the DL
relation matrix.

**Proof sketch (homomorphism property).** For $\beta, \gamma \in \mathcal{O}_K^*$:

$$(\beta\gamma)^\varepsilon - 1 = \beta^\varepsilon \gamma^\varepsilon - 1
  = (\beta^\varepsilon - 1) + (\gamma^\varepsilon - 1) + (\beta^\varepsilon - 1)(\gamma^\varepsilon - 1).$$

Since $\beta^\varepsilon \equiv 1 \pmod{\ell}$ and $\gamma^\varepsilon \equiv 1 \pmod{\ell}$,
the cross term $(\beta^\varepsilon - 1)(\gamma^\varepsilon - 1) \equiv 0 \pmod{\ell^2}$.
Dividing by $\ell$ and evaluating at $\alpha = r_0$:

$$\lambda_\varphi(\beta\gamma) = \lambda_\varphi(\beta) + \lambda_\varphi(\gamma) \pmod{\ell}.$$

$\square$

### The Schirokauer columns in the DL matrix

Each DL relation $(a, b)$ contributes one Schirokauer column per ideal $\varphi_i$: the value
$\lambda_{\varphi_i}(a - b\alpha) \in \mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z}$. These columns are appended to
the exponent vector to form the full DL relation row:

$$\text{row}(a, b) = \bigl(\underbrace{e_1, \ldots, e_k}_{\text{rational exponents}},\;
  \underbrace{f_1, \ldots, f_m}_{\text{algebraic exponents}},\;
  \underbrace{\lambda_1(a-b\alpha), \ldots, \lambda_r(a-b\alpha)}_{\text{Schirokauer columns}}\bigr)
  \in \mathbb{F}_\ell^{k+m+r}.$$

The Schirokauer columns ensure that the kernel of the augmented matrix gives the correct virtual
logs — including the unit-group correction that the exponent vectors alone would miss.

**Contrast with GNFS.** In GNFS, the quadratic-character columns are Legendre symbols
$\left(\frac{a - bs}{q}\right) \in \{+1, -1\}$ — elements of $\{0, 1\} \subset \mathrm{GF}(2)$.
In NFS-DL, the Schirokauer columns are $\ell$-adic log extractions in $\mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z}$.
Both serve the same structural role (resolving an obstruction to the linear system's solvability),
but the obstruction is different (unit group vs class group) and the correction is different
($\ell$-adic log vs Legendre symbol).

**Code realisation.** The Schirokauer map is implemented in `gnfs/src/dl/schirokauer.rs`
(C-Schirokauer, frozen D.A.1). The function `schirokauer` computes the $r$-tuple
$(\lambda_{\varphi_1}(\beta), \ldots, \lambda_{\varphi_r}(\beta))$ for a number-field element
$\beta$ and a list of prime ideals. The `augment_relation` function in `gnfs/src/dl/relation.rs`
(C-DLRelation, frozen D.A.1) wraps each smooth factoring relation with its Schirokauer columns
to produce a `DLRelation`. See `gnfs/docs/PEDAGOGY.md` §64–§65 for the code-tour.

## §9.4 The $\mathbb{F}_\ell$ Linear Algebra Step

### The linear system over $\mathbb{F}_\ell$

The DL relation matrix $A$ is a $(k + \delta) \times (k + m + r)$ matrix over $\mathbb{F}_\ell$,
where:
- $k$ = number of rational factor-base primes,
- $m$ = number of algebraic factor-base ideals,
- $r$ = number of Schirokauer columns,
- $\delta$ = small excess (a few extra relations for numerical stability).

The rational and algebraic exponent columns are reduced modulo $\ell$ (from the integer exponent
vectors). The Schirokauer columns are already in $\mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z}$.

**The kernel.** The virtual-log table is the kernel of $A$ over $\mathbb{F}_\ell$: a vector
$x \in \mathbb{F}_\ell^{k+m+r}$ such that $A \cdot x = 0$. The first $k$ entries of $x$ are
the virtual logs of the rational factor-base primes; the next $m$ entries are the virtual logs
of the algebraic factor-base ideals; the last $r$ entries are Schirokauer correction terms.

**Why the kernel gives the virtual logs.** Each row of $A$ encodes the linear equation

$$\sum_i e_i \log_g(p_i) + \sum_j f_j \log_g(\phi_\alpha(\mathfrak{p}_j)) +
  \sum_s \lambda_s(a - b\alpha) \cdot c_s \equiv 0 \pmod{\ell},$$

where $c_s$ are the Schirokauer correction coefficients. A kernel vector $x$ satisfying $A \cdot
x = 0$ is a consistent assignment of virtual logs to all factor-base elements (and Schirokauer
corrections) that satisfies every relation simultaneously. Under the standard heuristic
assumptions, the kernel is one-dimensional (up to scalar multiples), and the unique kernel vector
(up to scaling) gives the virtual logs.

### Block Wiedemann and block Lanczos over $\mathbb{F}_\ell$

The kernel is found by the *block Wiedemann* or *block Lanczos* algorithm — the same Krylov
subspace methods used in GNFS (§5), but over $\mathbb{F}_\ell$ instead of $\mathrm{GF}(2)$.

**The algorithmic structure is identical.** Both algorithms:
1. Start with a random block vector $V_0 \in \mathbb{F}_\ell^{(k+m+r) \times w}$ (where $w$ is
   the block width).
2. Iterate $V_{i+1} = A^T A \cdot V_i$ (or $A \cdot A^T \cdot V_i$) to build a Krylov subspace.
3. Use the self-orthogonality of the Krylov sequence to find a null vector.

**The implementation difference.** In GNFS, the block width is $w = 64$ (one 64-bit word per
block vector entry, since $\mathrm{GF}(2)$ elements are bits). In NFS-DL, the block width is
$w = 32$ (one $\mathbb{F}_\ell$ element per entry, since field elements are larger than bits).
The scalar arithmetic changes from XOR (GF(2)) to modular multiplication and addition
($\mathbb{F}_\ell$). The convergence criterion changes from "the block vector is zero in GF(2)"
to "the inner-product matrix $V_i^T V_i$ is singular over $\mathbb{F}_\ell$".

**Complexity.** For a matrix with $k + m + r$ columns and $w$ non-zeros per row, the block
Lanczos/Wiedemann algorithm costs $O((k + m + r)^2)$ field operations over $\mathbb{F}_\ell$
(or $O((k + m + r) \cdot w_{\mathrm{nnz}})$ for a sparse matrix with $w_{\mathrm{nnz}}$ non-zeros
per row). In $L$-notation with $k + m + r \approx B = L_p[1/3, c]$:

$$\text{Linear algebra cost} = O\!\left(L_p[1/3, c]^2\right) = L_p\!\left[\tfrac{1}{3},\, 2c\right].$$

This is the *same* cost shape as the GF(2) linear algebra in GNFS. The field $\mathbb{F}_\ell$
vs $\mathrm{GF}(2)$ distinction changes the constant factor (field operations over $\mathbb{F}_\ell$
are more expensive than XOR), but not the $L$-notation exponent or constant. This is the first
half of the DL delta in the complexity derivation (§9.7).

**Code realisation.** The $\mathbb{F}_\ell$ block-solver substrate is implemented in
`gnfs/src/dl/linalg/blockvec_fl.rs` (C-LinAlgFl, frozen D.B.1). The types `FlBlockVec`,
`FlSparseMatrix`, `FlMatrixOperator`, `FlSolution`, `VirtualLogTable`, and the function
`recover_virtual_logs` are the frozen interface. See `gnfs/docs/PEDAGOGY.md` §65–§66 for the
code-tour.

## §9.5 Individual-Logarithm Special-$q$ Descent

*This section describes the stage with no factoring analogue — the part of NFS-DL that goes
beyond what GNFS needs.*

### The individual-logarithm problem

The linear algebra step (§9.4) recovers the virtual logs of all factor-base elements: $\log_g(p_i)
\bmod \ell$ for each rational prime $p_i \leq B$ and $\log_g(\phi_\alpha(\mathfrak{p}_j)) \bmod
\ell$ for each algebraic ideal $\mathfrak{p}_j$. But the target $h$ is not a factor-base element
— it is an arbitrary element of $\mathbb{F}_p^*$. The *individual-logarithm descent* bridges
this gap.

**The descent strategy.** The descent proceeds in two phases:

1. **Initialization-smoothing.** Find an exponent $e \geq 0$ such that $g^e \cdot h \bmod p$
   is smooth over a *medium-prime bound* $B'$ (with $B < B' \ll p$). Then
   $\log_g(h) = \log_g(g^e \cdot h) - e \pmod{\ell}$, so it suffices to compute
   $\log_g(g^e \cdot h)$.

2. **Special-$q$ descent.** The smooth factorisation of $g^e \cdot h$ involves primes in
   $(B, B']$ — the *medium primes* — whose logs are not yet known. For each medium prime $q$,
   find a DL relation that expresses $\log_g(q)$ as a linear combination of logs of smaller
   primes. Repeat until all primes are factor-base leaves with known virtual logs.

### Initialization-smoothing

**The smoothing step.** Iterate $e = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$ and compute $c_e = g^e \cdot h \bmod p$.
Trial-divide $c_e$ by all primes up to $B'$. If $c_e$ factors completely over primes $\leq B'$,
the smoothing succeeds with exponent $e$ and factorisation $c_e = \prod_i q_i^{a_i}$.

The expected number of trials before a smooth $c_e$ is found is $\rho(u')^{-1}$, where
$u' = \log p / \log B'$ and $\rho$ is the Dickman function. For $B' = L_p[1/3, c']$, this is
$L_p[1/3, 1/(3c')]$ trials — subexponential in $\log p$.

**The initial frontier.** The smooth factorisation $c_e = \prod_i q_i^{a_i}$ gives the *initial
frontier*: the set of prime factors $q_i$ (with multiplicity) that must be descended. Factor-base
primes ($q_i \leq B$) are leaves with known virtual logs; medium primes ($B < q_i \leq B'$) are
interior nodes that must be descended.

### The special-$q$ descent recursion

**The descent step.** For a medium prime $q$ in the frontier, the descent finds a DL relation
that rewrites $\log_g(q)$ as a combination of logs of smaller primes. Specifically, it runs the
special-$q$ sieve with $q$ as the special prime: sieve for pairs $(a, b)$ such that $q \mid
N_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(a - b\alpha)$ and both norms are smooth over primes $< q$. Such a relation gives

$$e_q \cdot \log_g(q) \equiv \sum_{p_i < q} e_i \log_g(p_i) \pmod{\ell},$$

where $e_q$ is the exponent of $q$ in the algebraic norm and $e_i$ are the exponents of the
smaller primes. Since $e_q \not\equiv 0 \pmod{\ell}$ (generically), this gives
$\log_g(q) \equiv e_q^{-1} \sum_i e_i \log_g(p_i) \pmod{\ell}$.

**The termination invariant.** The descent tree is a max-heap ordered by prime descending. Each
step pops the largest prime $q$, finds a relation rewriting $\log_g(q)$ in terms of strictly
smaller primes, and pushes those smaller primes back. Since each step strictly reduces the
largest prime, the descent terminates when all frontier elements are factor-base leaves.

**The descent tree.** The descent produces a tree of `DescentNode` objects:
- **Leaf nodes** are factor-base elements with known virtual logs (from the `VirtualLogTable`).
- **Interior nodes** are medium primes with a rewriting relation and child nodes for the smaller
  primes.

The tree has depth $O(\log \log p)$ in the asymptotic regime (since each level reduces the
prime by a constant factor in the $L$-notation sense), but at toy scale the depth is 0 or 1
(the smoothing step often finds $g^e \cdot h$ already smooth over the factor base).

### Log assembly along the descent tree

Once the descent tree is complete (all leaves have known virtual logs), the log of $g^e \cdot h$
is assembled by a bottom-up traversal:

- **Leaf:** $\log_g(q) = \text{known\_log}(q)$ from the virtual-log table.
- **Interior node:** $\log_g(q) = \sum_{\text{children}} \log_g(\text{child}) \pmod{\ell}$,
  where the sum is over all children with multiplicity (a child appearing twice contributes its
  log twice).

The assembled log of $g^e \cdot h$ is the sum of the logs of the initial frontier targets. Then:

$$\log_g(h) = \log_g(g^e \cdot h) - e \pmod{\ell}.$$

### Subgroup recovery

The descent recovers $\log_g(h) \bmod \ell$, where $\ell$ is the subgroup order. If $\ell = p - 1$
(the full group order), this is the complete discrete log. If $\ell < p - 1$, the result is the
log in the $\ell$-order subgroup. Recovering the full log modulo $p - 1$ requires Pohlig–Hellman
(§Prerequisites): factor $p - 1 = \prod_i \ell_i^{e_i}$, run NFS-DL for each prime power
$\ell_i^{e_i}$, and combine via CRT.

**Code realisation.** The descent substrate is implemented in `gnfs/src/dl/descent/` (C-Descent,
frozen D.C.1; C2, frozen D.C.3). The key types and functions are `DescentNode<F>`,
`DescentFrontier<F>`, `init_descent_frontier`, `descend_node`, `run_descent`, and `assemble_log`.
The frozen C2 interface `solve_dl(g, h, p, k, ell)` is the cross-track entry point consumed by
E.C (the MOV bridge). See `gnfs/docs/PEDAGOGY.md` §66 for the code-tour.

**Engineering-scale boundary ($k > 1$, principle-4 annotation).** The `solve_dl` function
returns `SolveDlError::Unsupported { k }` immediately for $k > 1$ (extension fields
$\mathbb{F}_{p^k}$). This is an *engineering-scale boundary, not a mathematical one*: the
mathematics of NFS-DL over extension fields is well-understood (the number field $K$ is replaced
by a degree-$k$ extension; the Schirokauer map adapts; the descent works over the extended
field), but the implementation requires adapting the `PolyPair` / `NumberField` / `FactorBase`
infrastructure to the extension-field structure. This is a non-trivial engineering task deferred
to the E.C-prep session (Track E). The debt is recorded here as a principle-4 annotation (see
§On Scale for the three-axis framework): the code is correct at demonstration fidelity for $k = 1$;
the $k > 1$ path is a known gap, not a silent omission.

## §9.6 Design-Statement Verification for the NFS-DL Arc

*This section is the D.W.2 analogue of G.W §59 — the design-statement verification for the
whole NFS-DL arc (Track D, D.A → D.B → D.C → D.W), against the three principles.*

### Principle 1: Algorithmic content complete

**Verdict: pass.** The NFS-DL pipeline implements the algorithmic content of NFS-DL for prime
fields end-to-end:

- **Relation collection (D.A):** Smooth-pair sieving reusing the GNFS infrastructure, augmented
  with Schirokauer map columns. The `DLMatrix` type (C-DLRelation) carries the full column
  layout (rational | algebraic | Schirokauer).
- **$\mathbb{F}_\ell$ linear algebra (D.B):** Block Lanczos / block Wiedemann over $\mathbb{F}_\ell$,
  recovering the virtual-log table. The `VirtualLogTable` type (C-LinAlgFl) is the frozen
  interface to D.C.
- **Individual-logarithm descent (D.C):** Initialization-smoothing, special-$q$ descent
  recursion, and log assembly. The `solve_dl_full` function runs the full pipeline; the frozen
  C2 `solve_dl` is the cross-track interface.

No algorithmic stage is silently omitted or replaced by a lookup table.

### Principle 3: No engineering optimisations crept in

**Verdict: pass.** The implementation is at *demonstration fidelity* — the mathematical content
is present, but the engineering optimisations that make NFS-DL run at cryptographic scale are
not implemented:

- **Large-prime variations** (partial relations with one or two large prime cofactors) are not
  implemented. The sieve collects only fully smooth relations.
- **Optimal polynomial selection** for NFS-DL (calibrated to $p$ and $\ell$) is not implemented.
  The base-$m$ construction is used.
- **Lattice sieving** for the descent step is not implemented. The line sieve is used.
- **Pohlig–Hellman** for the full group order is not implemented. The log is recovered modulo
  $\ell$ only.

None of these omissions affect the correctness of the algorithm at toy scale. They are
engineering optimisations that improve performance at NFS scale but are not needed for the
mathematical demonstration.

### Principle 4: Scale-only at demonstration fidelity

**Verdict: pass, with annotations.** The following phenomena are annotated as scale-only:

- **Descent-tree depth.** At toy scale ($p = 11$, factor base $\{2, 3\}$, $\ell = 5$), the
  descent tree has depth 0: the initialization-smoothing step finds $g^e \cdot h$ already smooth
  over the factor base, so no medium primes need to be descended. At NFS scale, the tree has
  depth $O(\log \log p)$ — typically 3–5 levels. The depth is a scale-only phenomenon.

- **Medium-prime tuning.** The medium-prime bound $B'$ is a critical parameter at NFS scale.
  At toy scale, the frozen C2 `solve_dl` uses a hardcoded `medium_bound = 100`; `solve_dl_full`
  uses the factor-base bound. At NFS scale, $B'$ is calibrated to the factor-base bound and the
  expected descent depth.

- **Block width.** The $\mathbb{F}_\ell$ block width `FL_BLOCK_WIDTH = 32` is a cache-friendly
  unit for the inner loop at NFS scale. At toy scale, the blocking overhead is invisible.

- **$k > 1$ `Unsupported` debt.** The $\mathbb{F}_{p^k}$ extension is an engineering-scale
  boundary (see §9.5 above). The mathematics is complete for $k = 1$; the $k > 1$ path is a
  known gap recorded as a principle-4 annotation.

## §9.7 The $L$-Notation Complexity of NFS-DL

*This is the designated payoff proof for the T.D chapter (C-Textbook contract). It is a
**delta** on the §GNFS §7 derivation — not a re-derivation from scratch. The reader should
read §GNFS §7 first; this section identifies the two DL-specific differences and shows that
neither changes the leading complexity.*

### The §GNFS §7 derivation: what it establishes

The §GNFS §7 derivation (§7 of the GNFS chapter above) establishes:

1. **The exponent is $1/3$**: the sieve cost is $L_N[1/3, c + 2/(3c)]$ and the linear algebra
   cost is $L_N[1/3, 2c]$; the crossover at $c = \sqrt{2/3}$ gives total cost
   $L_N[1/3, 2\sqrt{6}/3]$ (simplified) or $L_N[1/3, (64/9)^{1/3}]$ (full analysis).

2. **The constant is $(64/9)^{1/3}$**: the full analysis (Lenstra–Lenstra–Manasse–Pollard
   [LLMP93], Buhler–Lenstra–Pomerance [BLP93]) accounts for the polynomial degree optimisation
   and the two-sided sieve, yielding the standard constant.

The derivation uses:
- Smoothness bound $B = L_N[1/3, c]$.
- Norm size $\approx N^{1/d}$ at optimal degree $d$.
- Smoothness probability (one norm) $= L_N[-1/3, -1/(3c)]$.
- Sieve cost $= L_N[1/3, c + 2/(3c)]$ (collecting $B$ smooth pairs).
- Linear algebra cost $= L_N[1/3, 2c]$ (null vector in $B \times B$ matrix over GF(2)).
- Optimal $c = \sqrt{2/3}$ (simplified) or $c = (8/9)^{1/3}$ (full).

### The NFS-DL delta: two differences

NFS-DL differs from GNFS in two ways that could, in principle, change the leading complexity.
We show that neither does.

#### Delta 1: $\mathbb{F}_\ell$ linear algebra vs GF(2)

In GNFS, the linear algebra step finds a null vector in a $B \times B$ matrix over GF(2). In
NFS-DL, the linear algebra step finds a null vector in a $B \times B$ matrix over $\mathbb{F}_\ell$.

**The $L$-notation cost is the same.** The block Lanczos / block Wiedemann algorithm costs
$O(B^2)$ field operations in both cases (for a dense matrix; $O(B \cdot w_{\mathrm{nnz}})$ for
sparse). In $L$-notation:

$$\text{NFS-DL linear algebra cost} = O\!\left(L_p[1/3, c]^2\right) = L_p\!\left[\tfrac{1}{3},\, 2c\right].$$

This is identical to the GNFS linear algebra cost $L_N[1/3, 2c]$. The field $\mathbb{F}_\ell$
vs GF(2) distinction changes the *constant factor* inside the $O(\cdot)$ (field operations over
$\mathbb{F}_\ell$ are more expensive than XOR), but not the $L$-notation exponent or constant.
The $L$-notation is insensitive to polynomial factors in the constant, so the leading complexity
is unchanged.

**Formal statement.** Let $T_{\mathrm{GF}(2)}(B)$ and $T_{\mathbb{F}_\ell}(B)$ be the costs of
finding a null vector in a $B \times B$ matrix over GF(2) and $\mathbb{F}_\ell$ respectively.
Then $T_{\mathrm{GF}(2)}(B) = O(B^2)$ and $T_{\mathbb{F}_\ell}(B) = O(B^2 \cdot \log \ell)$
(since each $\mathbb{F}_\ell$ operation costs $O(\log \ell)$ bit operations). In $L$-notation
with $B = L_p[1/3, c]$ and $\ell \leq p - 1 = L_p[1, 1]$:

$$T_{\mathbb{F}_\ell}(B) = O\!\left(L_p[1/3, c]^2 \cdot \log p\right)
  = L_p\!\left[\tfrac{1}{3},\, 2c\right] \cdot O(\log p).$$

The factor $O(\log p)$ is polynomial in $\log p$ — it is $L_p[0, 1]$ in $L$-notation, which is
dominated by $L_p[1/3, 2c]$ for any $c > 0$. Therefore:

$$T_{\mathbb{F}_\ell}(B) = L_p\!\left[\tfrac{1}{3},\, 2c\right] \cdot (1 + o(1)).$$

The $\mathbb{F}_\ell$ linear algebra has the same $L$-notation cost as the GF(2) linear algebra.
$\square$

#### Delta 2: Individual-logarithm descent is asymptotically subdominant

In GNFS, there is no descent step: the linear algebra step directly yields a factor. In NFS-DL,
the individual-logarithm descent is an additional stage. Could it dominate the total cost?

**The descent cost.** The descent for a single target $h$ consists of:

1. **Initialization-smoothing:** Find $e$ such that $g^e \cdot h$ is smooth over $B' = L_p[1/3, c']$.
   Expected number of trials: $\rho(u')^{-1}$ where $u' = \log p / \log B'$. For $B' = L_p[1/3, c']$:

   $$\rho(u')^{-1} = L_p\!\left[\tfrac{1}{3},\, \tfrac{1}{3c'}\right] \cdot (1 + o(1)).$$

   Each trial costs $O(\log p)$ (one modular multiplication). Total smoothing cost:

   $$L_p\!\left[\tfrac{1}{3},\, \tfrac{1}{3c'}\right] \cdot O(\log p)
     = L_p\!\left[\tfrac{1}{3},\, \tfrac{1}{3c'}\right] \cdot (1 + o(1)).$$

2. **Special-$q$ descent:** For each medium prime $q \in (B, B']$, find a rewriting relation.
   The descent tree has depth $D = O(\log(B'/B) / \log(B/B_{\min}))$ — in the asymptotic regime,
   $D = O(1)$ (a constant number of levels, since $B$ and $B'$ are both $L_p[1/3, \cdot]$).
   Each descent step costs one sieve run: $O(B \cdot \log B)$ operations. Total descent cost:

   $$D \cdot O(B \log B) = O(1) \cdot L_p\!\left[\tfrac{1}{3},\, c\right] \cdot O(\log p)
     = L_p\!\left[\tfrac{1}{3},\, c\right] \cdot (1 + o(1)).$$

**Comparing descent cost to precomputation cost.** The precomputation cost (sieve + linear
algebra) is $L_p[1/3, (64/9)^{1/3}]$. The descent cost for a single target is at most
$L_p[1/3, c + 1/(3c')]$ (the larger of the smoothing and descent costs). For any choice of
$c, c' > 0$, the descent cost is $L_p[1/3, \cdot]$ with a constant that is at most as large as
the precomputation constant.

**The key point.** The descent cost is $L_p[1/3, \cdot]$ — the same $L$-notation *exponent*
as the precomputation. It is not a lower-order term in the absolute sense. However, it is
*subdominant* in the following precise sense: the descent cost for a *single* target $h$ is
$L_p[1/3, c_{\mathrm{descent}}]$ for some constant $c_{\mathrm{descent}}$, while the
precomputation cost is $L_p[1/3, (64/9)^{1/3}]$. The total cost is

$$\text{Total cost} = L_p\!\left[\tfrac{1}{3},\, \max\!\left((64/9)^{1/3},\, c_{\mathrm{descent}}\right)\right].$$

The descent constant $c_{\mathrm{descent}}$ can be made smaller than $(64/9)^{1/3}$ by choosing
$B'$ appropriately (specifically, $B' = B = L_p[1/3, (8/9)^{1/3}]$, so that the smoothing and
descent costs are both dominated by the precomputation). With this choice:

$$c_{\mathrm{descent}} \leq (8/9)^{1/3} + \tfrac{1}{3(8/9)^{1/3}} < (64/9)^{1/3}.$$

Therefore the descent does not increase the leading constant, and the total cost remains
$L_p[1/3, (64/9)^{1/3}]$.

**Formal statement (descent subdominance).** *Under the heuristic smoothness assumptions, the
individual-logarithm descent for a single target $h$ costs at most $L_p[1/3, c_{\mathrm{descent}}]$
with $c_{\mathrm{descent}} < (64/9)^{1/3}$. The total NFS-DL cost (precomputation + descent) is
therefore $L_p[1/3, (64/9)^{1/3}] \cdot (1 + o(1))$, the same as the precomputation alone.*

*Proof sketch.* The smoothing cost is $L_p[1/3, 1/(3c')]$ for $B' = L_p[1/3, c']$. The descent
cost is $O(D) \cdot L_p[1/3, c]$ where $D = O(1)$ is the tree depth. Setting $c' = c$ (the
same smoothness bound for smoothing and precomputation) gives total descent cost
$L_p[1/3, c + 1/(3c)]$. At the optimal $c = (8/9)^{1/3}$:

$$c + \frac{1}{3c} = \left(\frac{8}{9}\right)^{1/3} + \frac{1}{3(8/9)^{1/3}}
  = \left(\frac{8}{9}\right)^{1/3} + \frac{1}{3} \cdot \left(\frac{9}{8}\right)^{1/3}
  = \left(\frac{8}{9}\right)^{1/3}\!\left(1 + \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{9}{8}\right)
  = \left(\frac{8}{9}\right)^{1/3} \cdot \frac{11}{8}.$$

Numerically: $(8/9)^{1/3} \approx 0.961$, so $c + 1/(3c) \approx 0.961 \cdot 1.375 \approx
1.321$. The precomputation constant is $(64/9)^{1/3} \approx 1.923$. Since $1.321 < 1.923$,
the descent cost is strictly dominated by the precomputation cost. $\square$

### The main theorem: NFS-DL and GNFS share the same $L$-notation complexity

**Theorem (NFS-DL complexity, heuristic).** *Under standard heuristic assumptions on the
distribution of smooth norms, NFS-DL computes $\log_g(h)$ in $\mathbb{F}_p^*$ in expected time*

$$L_p\!\left[\tfrac{1}{3},\, \left(\tfrac{64}{9}\right)^{1/3}\right] \cdot (1 + o(1)).$$

*This is the same complexity as GNFS for factoring an integer $N \approx p$.*

**Proof (delta on §GNFS §7).** The precomputation (relation collection + $\mathbb{F}_\ell$ linear
algebra) has the same cost as GNFS:

- **Relation collection:** The sieve cost is $L_p[1/3, c + 2/(3c)]$ (same as GNFS §7, with $p$
  in place of $N$). The norms have size $\approx p^{1/d}$ at optimal degree $d$; the smoothness
  probability is $L_p[-1/3, -1/(3c)]$ per norm; collecting $B = L_p[1/3, c]$ relations costs
  $L_p[1/3, c + 2/(3c)]$.

- **$\mathbb{F}_\ell$ linear algebra:** The cost is $L_p[1/3, 2c]$ (Delta 1 above: same as GF(2)).

- **Optimisation:** The total precomputation cost is $L_p[1/3, \max(c + 2/(3c), 2c)]$, minimised
  at $c = \sqrt{2/3}$ (simplified) or $c = (8/9)^{1/3}$ (full), giving $L_p[1/3, (64/9)^{1/3}]$
  (full analysis, citing [LLMP93] and [BLP93] as in §GNFS §7).

- **Individual-logarithm descent:** The descent cost is $L_p[1/3, c_{\mathrm{descent}}]$ with
  $c_{\mathrm{descent}} < (64/9)^{1/3}$ (Delta 2 above). It does not increase the leading
  constant.

Therefore the total NFS-DL cost is $L_p[1/3, (64/9)^{1/3}] \cdot (1 + o(1))$. $\square$

### The asymptotic comparison: why NFS-DL and GNFS share the same complexity

The equality of the NFS-DL and GNFS complexities is not a coincidence — it is a structural
consequence of the fact that both algorithms are driven by the *same* bottleneck: the balance
between the sieve cost and the linear algebra cost.

**The shared bottleneck.** In both algorithms:
- The sieve cost is $L[1/3, c + 2/(3c)]$ (collecting smooth pairs from norms of size $\approx
  N^{1/d}$ or $p^{1/d}$).
- The linear algebra cost is $L[1/3, 2c]$ (finding a null vector in a $B \times B$ matrix).
- The optimal $c$ is the crossover point where the two costs are equal.

The DL-specific stages (Schirokauer maps, $\mathbb{F}_\ell$ arithmetic, individual-logarithm
descent) do not change this balance:
- Schirokauer maps add $r$ columns to the matrix, but $r = O(1)$ (a constant number of ideals),
  so the matrix size is still $B \times B$ in $L$-notation.
- $\mathbb{F}_\ell$ arithmetic changes the constant factor in the linear algebra cost, but not
  the $L$-notation exponent or constant (Delta 1).
- The individual-logarithm descent is subdominant (Delta 2).

**The through-line at its sharpest.** The equality $L_p[1/3, (64/9)^{1/3}] = L_N[1/3,
(64/9)^{1/3}]$ (for $p \approx N$) is the structure-based escape from search at its sharpest:
two different problems (factoring and discrete logarithm), solved by two different algorithms
(GNFS and NFS-DL), with two different outputs (a factor vs a discrete log), but with the *same*
asymptotic complexity. The reason is that both algorithms exploit the *same* structure — the
number-field bridge and the smoothness of norms — and are limited by the *same* bottleneck —
the sieve/linear-algebra balance.

This is why the $L[1/3]$ barrier is believed to be a genuine barrier for both problems: any
algorithm that breaks it for one problem would likely break it for the other, since the
bottleneck is shared.

### Summary of the derivation

| Quantity | GNFS (§7) | NFS-DL (§9.7) |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Smoothness bound | $B = L_N[1/3, c]$ | $B = L_p[1/3, c]$ |
| Norm size | $\approx N^{1/d}$ | $\approx p^{1/d}$ |
| Smoothness probability (one norm) | $L_N[-1/3, -1/(3c)]$ | $L_p[-1/3, -1/(3c)]$ |
| Sieve cost | $L_N[1/3, c + 2/(3c)]$ | $L_p[1/3, c + 2/(3c)]$ |
| Linear algebra field | GF(2) | $\mathbb{F}_\ell$ |
| Linear algebra cost | $L_N[1/3, 2c]$ | $L_p[1/3, 2c]$ (Delta 1) |
| Descent cost | — (no descent) | $L_p[1/3, c_{\mathrm{descent}}] < L_p[1/3, (64/9)^{1/3}]$ (Delta 2) |
| Optimal $c$ | $(8/9)^{1/3}$ (full) | $(8/9)^{1/3}$ (full) |
| Total cost | $L_N[1/3, (64/9)^{1/3}]$ | $L_p[1/3, (64/9)^{1/3}]$ |

The exponent $1/3$ and the constant $(64/9)^{1/3}$ are the same for both problems. The DL
content is entirely in the two deltas: $\mathbb{F}_\ell$ linear algebra (same cost shape as
GF(2)) and individual-logarithm descent (asymptotically subdominant).

### Cross-references within this textbook

**Code realisation.** The NFS-DL pipeline — relation collection with Schirokauer augmentation,
$\mathbb{F}_\ell$ linear algebra, and individual-logarithm descent — is implemented in the
`gnfs` crate and documented in `gnfs/docs/PEDAGOGY.md` §63–§71. That chapter is the code-tour
sibling to this one: it assumes the reader knows the mathematics (this chapter) and focuses on
the Rust realisation, the stage-by-stage contracts, and the KAT summary.

**§GNFS §7 (the shared derivation core).** The L-notation derivation in §9.7 is a delta on the
§GNFS §7 derivation. The reader should read §GNFS §7 first; §9.7 identifies the two DL-specific
differences (Delta 1: $\mathbb{F}_\ell$ vs GF(2); Delta 2: descent subdominance) and shows that
neither changes the leading complexity. The full derivation of the exponent $1/3$ and the
constant $(64/9)^{1/3}$ is in §GNFS §7; §9.7 re-uses it by reference.

**§Prerequisites.** The prerequisites used in this chapter:
- The Canfield–Erdős–Pomerance smooth-number density theorem and the $L$-notation (§Analysis,
  §Probability) — the engine of the complexity derivation.
- The discrete logarithm problem and Pohlig–Hellman (§Logic and complexity) — for subgroup
  recovery.
- Unique factorisation of ideals in Dedekind domains (§Algebra) — for the algebraic factor base.
- The $L$-notation arithmetic lemma (§Analysis) — for the cost calculations in §9.7.

**§On Scale.** The honest science↔engineering gap — the gap between the asymptotic complexity
$L_p[1/3, (64/9)^{1/3}]$ and the behaviour at toy scale — is discussed in §On Scale. The
key points for NFS-DL: the descent-tree depth is a scale-only phenomenon (depth 0 at toy scale,
$O(\log \log p)$ at NFS scale); the medium-prime tuning is invisible at toy scale; the
$\mathbb{F}_{p^k}$ $k > 1$ `Unsupported` debt is an engineering-scale boundary (mathematical-
dimension axis, not resource/operational axis).

### §10.0 The through-line for this chapter

The §"Escape from Search" chapter above established the five-family structure taxonomy and the
L-notation hierarchy. This chapter extends that taxonomy per-attack: each of the five algebraic
ECDLP attacks finds a specific curve structure that escapes the generic $\sqrt{n}$ bound the
Pollard rho chapter (§Pollard Rho for ECDLP) established.

The five structures, named here and developed in the sections below:

1. **Composite group order** (Pohlig–Hellman, §10.1): $\#E$ composite $\Rightarrow$ CRT
   reduction to prime-order subgroup DLPs.
2. **Anomalous order** (Smart–Satoh–Araki, §10.2): $\#E(\mathbb{F}_p) = p$ $\Rightarrow$
   p-adic lift + formal group logarithm gives polynomial time.
3. **Binary field tower** (GHS/Weil descent, §10.3): $E/\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ with subfield
   $\mathbb{F}_{2^l}$ $\Rightarrow$ Weil restriction transfers ECDLP to a hyperelliptic
   Jacobian DLP (a transfer, not an end-to-end solve).
4. **Factor-base decomposability** (index calculus, §10.4): Semaev-decomposable points
   $\Rightarrow$ relation matrix over $\mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z}$; asymptotic win in the
   extension-field setting.
5. **Small embedding degree** (MOV/Frey–Rück, §10.5): $\ell \mid p^k - 1$ for small $k$
   $\Rightarrow$ bilinear pairing maps ECDLP to $\mathbb{F}_{p^k}^*$ DLP, where index calculus
   applies (the cross-track bridge to NFS-DL).

The chapter follows the ordering Pohlig–Hellman → SSA → GHS → index calculus → MOV, placing
MOV last as the designated climax: the chapter builds the engine (index calculus) before
presenting the bridge (MOV) that connects ECDLP to that engine.

### §10.1 Pohlig–Hellman: CRT to Prime-Order Subgroups

#### The structure

The group order $n = \#E(\mathbb{F}_p)$ is composite: $n = \prod_{i=1}^r p_i^{e_i}$. The
Chinese Remainder Theorem (§Prerequisites) gives an isomorphism

$$\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} \;\cong\; \mathbb{Z}/p_1^{e_1}\mathbb{Z} \times \cdots \times
\mathbb{Z}/p_r^{e_r}\mathbb{Z}.$$

The ECDLP in $\langle G \rangle$ (a cyclic group of order $n$) therefore reduces to independent
DLPs in each prime-power subgroup $\langle G_i \rangle$ of order $p_i^{e_i}$.

#### The escape

**Subgroup projection.** For each prime power $p_i^{e_i}$, define

$$G_i = \frac{n}{p_i^{e_i}} \cdot G, \qquad Q_i = \frac{n}{p_i^{e_i}} \cdot Q.$$

Then $G_i$ has order $p_i^{e_i}$ and $Q_i = k \cdot G_i$ in $\langle G_i \rangle$. The ECDLP
in the full group reduces to the ECDLP $Q_i = k_i \cdot G_i$ in the prime-power subgroup, where
$k_i = k \bmod p_i^{e_i}$.

**Prime-power lift.** For $e_i > 1$, recover $k_i = k \bmod p_i^{e_i}$ digit-by-digit in base
$p_i$. At digit step $j$ (recovering $k_i \bmod p_i^{j+1}$ from $k_i \bmod p_i^j$), project to
the order-$p_i$ sub-subgroup and solve a single DLP in a group of prime order $p_i$ — one rho
call.

**CRT reconstruction.** Given $k_i = k \bmod p_i^{e_i}$ for each $i$, the CRT gives $k \bmod n$
uniquely.

#### Proof sketch

The key step is the subgroup projection: $G_i = (n/p_i^{e_i}) \cdot G$ has order $p_i^{e_i}$
because $p_i^{e_i} \cdot G_i = n \cdot G = \mathcal{O}$, and no smaller multiple of $G_i$ is
$\mathcal{O}$ (since $n/p_i^{e_i}$ is the exact cofactor). The projection $Q_i = (n/p_i^{e_i})
\cdot Q = (n/p_i^{e_i}) \cdot k \cdot G = k \cdot G_i$ follows directly.

The prime-power lift is a standard Hensel-style digit extraction: at step $j$, the known
$k_i \bmod p_i^j$ is subtracted from $Q_i$ (scaled by the appropriate cofactor), and the
residue is projected to the order-$p_i$ sub-subgroup for a single rho call.

#### L-notation

The cost is $O\!\left(\sum_{i=1}^r e_i (\log n + \sqrt{p_i})\right)$. For a group of prime
order $n$, this is $O(\sqrt{n})$ — the same as rho. The gain is structural, not asymptotic:
when $n$ has small prime factors, the cost is dominated by $\sqrt{p_{\max}}$ (the largest prime
factor), which can be exponentially smaller than $\sqrt{n}$.

In L-notation: Pohlig–Hellman achieves $L_n[1, 1/2]$ in the worst case (prime $n$), but
$L_{p_{\max}}[1, 1/2]$ when $n$ has a small largest prime factor. The asymptotic gain over rho
is structural, not a change in the $L$-notation exponent.

**Principle-4 annotation.** At toy scale ($n = 60 = 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5$), the speedup over
rho is invisible — the group is too small for the birthday bound to be meaningful. At crypto
scale, Pohlig–Hellman is catastrophic for curves whose order has a small largest prime factor
(e.g. $n = 2^{255} \cdot q$ for a small $q$).

### §10.2 Smart–Satoh–Araki: The Anomalous-Curve Polynomial-Time Attack

#### The structure

The curve is *anomalous*: $\#E(\mathbb{F}_p) = p$ (equivalently, the trace of Frobenius
$t = p + 1 - \#E = 1$). This is a rare but constructible condition. The anomalous structure
admits a polynomial-time ECDLP algorithm via the p-adic formal group.

#### The escape

**The formal group.** The formal group $\hat{E}$ of an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a
one-dimensional formal group law $\hat{F}(X, Y) \in \mathbb{Z}_p[[X, Y]]$ that encodes the
group law of $E$ in a neighbourhood of the identity. The formal group logarithm
$\log_{\hat{E}}: p\mathbb{Z}_p \to p\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a power series that linearises the formal
group law.

**The Hensel lift.** Given $G = (x_0, y_0) \in E(\mathbb{F}_p)$, lift to
$\tilde{G} = (\tilde{x}, \tilde{y}) \in E(\mathbb{Z}/p^2\mathbb{Z})$ via Hensel's lemma: solve
$y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$ over $\mathbb{Z}/p^2\mathbb{Z}$ with $\tilde{x} \equiv x_0 \pmod{p}$ and
$\tilde{y} \equiv y_0 \pmod{p}$. The lift exists and is unique when $y_0 \neq 0$ (i.e. $G$ is
not a 2-torsion point), since $f'(y_0) = 2y_0 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{p}$ for $p > 2$.

**The p-adic logarithm.** The formal group logarithm maps $\tilde{G}$ to
$\log_{\hat{E}}(\tilde{G}) \in p\mathbb{Z}_p$. For the anomalous curve, the key identity is:

$$p \cdot \tilde{G} = \mathcal{O} \quad \text{in } E(\mathbb{Z}/p^2\mathbb{Z}),$$

which holds because $\#E(\mathbb{F}_p) = p$ implies $p \cdot G = \mathcal{O}$ in
$E(\mathbb{F}_p)$, and the lift preserves this. The formal group logarithm then gives:

$$\log_{\hat{E}}(p \cdot \tilde{G}) = p \cdot \log_{\hat{E}}(\tilde{G}) = 0 \quad
\text{in } p\mathbb{Z}_p / p^2\mathbb{Z}_p.$$

**The DLP recovery.** Given $Q = k \cdot G$, lift both to $\tilde{G}$ and $\tilde{Q}$. Then:

$$\log_{\hat{E}}(\tilde{Q}) = k \cdot \log_{\hat{E}}(\tilde{G}) \quad \text{in } p\mathbb{Z}_p,$$

so $k \equiv \log_{\hat{E}}(\tilde{Q}) / \log_{\hat{E}}(\tilde{G}) \pmod{p}$.

#### Proof sketch

The key step is that the formal group logarithm is a group homomorphism from $\hat{E}(p\mathbb{Z}_p)$
to $(p\mathbb{Z}_p, +)$. For the anomalous curve, the map $E(\mathbb{F}_p) \to \hat{E}(p\mathbb{Z}_p)$
(via the Hensel lift composed with the reduction-mod-$p$ map) is an isomorphism of groups of order
$p$. The formal group logarithm then linearises the ECDLP: the ratio of the two logarithms gives
$k$ directly. The computation requires only $O(\log p)$ arithmetic operations in $\mathbb{Z}/p^2\mathbb{Z}$.

#### L-notation

$L_p[0]$ — polynomial time. The Hensel lift and formal group logarithm each cost $O(\log p)$
arithmetic operations. This is the sharpest escape in this chapter: the anomalous structure
collapses the ECDLP to a linear computation.

**Principle-4 annotation.** The polynomial-time complexity is present at all scales. At toy
scale ($p = 7$), the constant factors are invisible — the computation is instantaneous. The
pedagogical content is the mechanism, not the timing.

### §10.3 GHS/Weil Descent: The Binary-Curve Transfer

#### The structure

The curve is defined over a binary field $E/\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ with a subfield tower
$\mathbb{F}_{2^l} \subset \mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ (with $l \mid m$). The Weil restriction
$\mathrm{Res}_{\mathbb{F}_{2^m}/\mathbb{F}_{2^l}}(E)$ is an abelian variety of dimension $m/l$
over $\mathbb{F}_{2^l}$. When $m/l$ is odd, this abelian variety contains the Jacobian of a
hyperelliptic curve $C/\mathbb{F}_{2^l}$ of genus $g = (m/l - 1)/2$.

#### The escape (as a transfer)

**This section represents GHS honestly as a transfer.** The GHS construction reduces the ECDLP
on $E/\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ to a DLP on the Jacobian $\mathrm{Jac}(C)/\mathbb{F}_{2^l}$. The
downstream solve — index calculus on the hyperelliptic Jacobian — is a separate step (a deferred
re-shard in this project). The chapter covers the descent reduction and log-preservation
verification; the downstream solve is not developed here.

**The Artin–Schreier extension.** The function field of $E/\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ is a degree-2
extension of $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}(x)$ defined by $y^2 + h(x)y = f(x)$ (the Artin–Schreier form
for characteristic 2). The Weil restriction replaces the field $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ with the
subfield $\mathbb{F}_{2^l}$ and raises the dimension from 1 to $m/l$: the single variable $x$
over $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ becomes $m/l$ variables over $\mathbb{F}_{2^l}$.

**The hyperelliptic curve.** The Weil restriction produces an abelian variety over
$\mathbb{F}_{2^l}$. When $m/l$ is odd (the imaginary hyperelliptic model), this abelian variety
is the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve $C/\mathbb{F}_{2^l}$ of genus $g = (m/l - 1)/2$.

**Log-preservation.** The transfer map $\phi: E(\mathbb{F}_{2^m}) \to \mathrm{Jac}(C)(\mathbb{F}_{2^l})$
is a group homomorphism. It preserves the discrete logarithm: if $Q = k \cdot G$ in
$E(\mathbb{F}_{2^m})$, then $\phi(Q) = k \cdot \phi(G)$ in $\mathrm{Jac}(C)(\mathbb{F}_{2^l})$.

#### L-notation

The L-notation for GHS is conditional on the genus $g$ of the hyperelliptic curve:

- For small genus $g$ (e.g. $g = 1$, which reduces to an elliptic curve DLP — no gain), the
  transfer does not help.
- For large genus $g$, index calculus on $\mathrm{Jac}(C)$ achieves subexponential complexity.
  The asymptotic win depends on the genus and the specific index-calculus algorithm applied.

The transfer itself (the descent reduction) costs $O(\mathrm{poly}(m))$ — polynomial in the
field extension degree. The asymptotic win, if any, comes from the downstream solve.

**Principle-4 annotation.** The toy fixture ($m = 6$, $l = 2$, $g = 1$) has genus 1 — the
hyperelliptic Jacobian is an elliptic curve, and the downstream DLP is no easier than the
original. The GHS construction is demonstrated at toy scale for the mechanism; the asymptotic
win requires larger $m/l$ (and hence larger genus).

### §10.4 Index Calculus: Semaev Decomposition over the Factor Base

#### The structure

The factor base $\mathcal{F} = \{F_1, \ldots, F_B\}$ is a set of points on $E$ with small
x-coordinates. A point $P \in E(\mathbb{F}_{p^n})$ is *decomposable* over $\mathcal{F}$ if
$P = \sum_{i=1}^m F_{j_i}$ for some $F_{j_i} \in \mathcal{F}$. The Semaev summation polynomial
$S_m$ detects decomposability: $S_m(x_{F_{j_1}}, \ldots, x_{F_{j_{m-1}}}, x_P) = 0$ iff $P$
decomposes with the given $F_{j_i}$.

#### The escape

**Relation collection.** Choose random scalars $k_i$ and compute $P_i = k_i \cdot G + l_i \cdot Q$
for random $l_i$. For each $P_i$, attempt to decompose $P_i$ over $\mathcal{F}$ using the
Semaev polynomial. A successful decomposition $P_i = \sum_j c_{ij} F_j$ gives a linear relation:

$$k_i + l_i \cdot k \equiv \sum_j c_{ij} \cdot \log_G(F_j) \pmod{\ell},$$

where $k = \log_G(Q)$ is the unknown and $\log_G(F_j)$ are the unknown factor-base logarithms.

**Linear algebra.** Collect $B + O(1)$ relations (one per factor-base element plus a small
overdetermination). The system is a $(B + O(1)) \times (B + 1)$ matrix over $\mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z}$.
Solve via block-Lanczos or block-Wiedemann (the same infrastructure as NFS-DL, §9) to recover
$\log_G(F_j)$ for each $j$ and hence $k = \log_G(Q)$.

**The Semaev polynomial.** $S_m(X_1, \ldots, X_m)$ is defined recursively:
- $S_2(X_1, X_2) = X_1 - X_2$ (trivial: two points sum to $\mathcal{O}$ iff they are equal).
- $S_3(X_1, X_2, X_3)$: the resultant of the chord-and-tangent addition formula, giving a
  degree-4 polynomial in each variable.
- $S_m = \mathrm{Res}_X(S_{m-1}(X_1, \ldots, X_{m-2}, X),\; S_3(X_{m-1}, X_m, X))$ for $m > 3$.

The degree of $S_m$ in each variable is $2^{m-2}$, growing exponentially with $m$.

#### Proof sketch

The key step is that $S_m(x_1, \ldots, x_m) = 0$ iff there exist $y_i$ such that
$(x_i, y_i) \in E$ and $(x_1, y_1) + \cdots + (x_m, y_m) = \mathcal{O}$. This follows from
the definition of the summation polynomial as the resultant of the addition law. The relation
collection loop finds decomposable points by evaluating $S_m$ at random multiples of $G$ and
$Q$; the linear algebra step recovers the discrete log from the collected relations.

#### L-notation

Over $E(\mathbb{F}_p)$ (the toy setting): index calculus is **not** faster than Pollard rho.
The asymptotic win requires the extension-field setting $E(\mathbb{F}_{p^n})$ with $n > 1$
(the Gaudry–Diem setting). In that setting, the complexity is subexponential:

$$\text{Index calculus over } E(\mathbb{F}_{p^n}) = L_{p^n}\!\left[\tfrac{1}{2}, c\right]
\quad \text{(heuristic, for } n > 1\text{)}.$$

The exponent $1/2$ is a genuine improvement over rho's $L[1, 1/2]$ (fully exponential), but
not as sharp as NFS-DL's $L[1/3]$.

**Principle-4 annotation.** The toy fixture operates over $E(\mathbb{F}_p)$ ($n = 1$). The
asymptotic win is not observable at toy scale — the mechanism is demonstrated, but the
complexity separation requires $n > 1$ (the deferred re-shard).

### §10.5 MOV/Frey–Rück: The Pairing Reduction (The Payoff Proof)

*This is the designated payoff proof for this chapter — the one full proof at C-Textbook
payoff depth. It is the cross-track bridge of this project: the MOV reduction connects the
ECDLP (Track E) to the NFS-DL setting (Track D), where index calculus applies.*

#### The structure

The curve $E/\mathbb{F}_p$ has *small embedding degree* $k$: $\ell \mid p^k - 1$ but
$\ell \nmid p^j - 1$ for $j < k$. Here $\ell$ is the prime order of the subgroup $\langle G
\rangle \subset E(\mathbb{F}_p)$ in which the ECDLP is posed.

The embedding degree $k$ is the smallest positive integer such that $\mathbb{F}_{p^k}$ contains
all $\ell$-th roots of unity — equivalently, $\mu_\ell \subset \mathbb{F}_{p^k}^*$.

#### The Weil pairing

**Definition.** Let $E[\ell] = \{P \in E(\overline{\mathbb{F}_p}) : \ell \cdot P = \mathcal{O}\}$
be the $\ell$-torsion subgroup of $E$ over the algebraic closure. The *Weil pairing* is a map

$$e_\ell: E[\ell] \times E[\ell] \to \mu_\ell \subset \overline{\mathbb{F}_p}^*$$

defined via the divisor theory of $E$. Concretely: for $P, Q \in E[\ell]$, choose rational
functions $f_P, f_Q$ on $E$ with divisors $\mathrm{div}(f_P) = \ell \cdot (P) - \ell \cdot
(\mathcal{O})$ and $\mathrm{div}(f_Q) = \ell \cdot (Q) - \ell \cdot (\mathcal{O})$. Then

$$e_\ell(P, Q) = \frac{f_P(Q + S)}{f_P(S)} \cdot \frac{f_Q(P + T)}{f_Q(T)}^{-1}$$

for generic auxiliary points $S, T$ (the value is independent of the choice of $S, T$).

**Bilinearity.** The Weil pairing is bilinear in both arguments:

$$e_\ell(P_1 + P_2, Q) = e_\ell(P_1, Q) \cdot e_\ell(P_2, Q), \qquad
e_\ell(P, Q_1 + Q_2) = e_\ell(P, Q_1) \cdot e_\ell(P, Q_2).$$

*Proof.* Bilinearity follows from the linearity of the divisor map: $\mathrm{div}(f_{P_1+P_2})
= \mathrm{div}(f_{P_1}) + \mathrm{div}(f_{P_2})$ (up to principal divisors), so $f_{P_1+P_2}
= f_{P_1} \cdot f_{P_2}$ (up to a constant), and the pairing value multiplies accordingly.
$\square$

**Non-degeneracy.** The Weil pairing is non-degenerate: for every $P \in E[\ell]$ with
$P \neq \mathcal{O}$, there exists $Q \in E[\ell]$ such that $e_\ell(P, Q) \neq 1$.

*Proof sketch.* Non-degeneracy follows from the Riemann–Roch theorem applied to the divisor
class group of $E$: the pairing is a perfect pairing on $E[\ell] \times E[\ell]$, which is a
free $\mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z}$-module of rank 2. See Silverman [S09, §III.8]. $\square$

**Galois equivariance.** For $\sigma \in \mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{F}_p}/\mathbb{F}_p)$:

$$e_\ell(\sigma(P), \sigma(Q)) = \sigma(e_\ell(P, Q)).$$

This implies that if $P, Q \in E(\mathbb{F}_p)$ (i.e. they are defined over $\mathbb{F}_p$),
then $e_\ell(P, Q) \in \mathbb{F}_{p^k}$ (the smallest field containing all $\ell$-th roots of
unity).

#### The Tate pairing and Miller's algorithm

The Weil pairing is theoretically clean but computationally expensive. In practice, the
*reduced Tate pairing* is used:

$$\hat{e}: E(\mathbb{F}_{p^k})[\ell] \times E(\mathbb{F}_{p^k}) / \ell E(\mathbb{F}_{p^k})
\to \mathbb{F}_{p^k}^* / (\mathbb{F}_{p^k}^*)^\ell.$$

After the *final exponentiation* (raising to the power $(p^k - 1)/\ell$), the reduced Tate
pairing lands in $\mu_\ell \subset \mathbb{F}_{p^k}^*$ and is efficiently computable via
*Miller's algorithm* in $O(k \log p)$ field operations.

**Miller's algorithm** evaluates the rational function $f_P$ (whose divisor is
$\ell \cdot (P) - \ell \cdot (\mathcal{O})$) at a point $Q$ by a double-and-add loop over the
binary expansion of $\ell$. At each step, the current function $f$ is updated by the line
function through the current accumulator point and the next doubling/addition. The final value
is $f_P(Q)$, which is then raised to the power $(p^k - 1)/\ell$ (the final exponentiation).

#### The MOV reduction

**Setup.** Let $G \in E(\mathbb{F}_p)$ have prime order $\ell$, and let $Q = k \cdot G$ be the
ECDLP target. Let $k$ be the embedding degree of $E$ with respect to $\ell$.

**Step 1: Choose a $\mu_\ell$-generator.** Find a point $R \in E(\mathbb{F}_{p^k})[\ell]$ such
that $e(G, R) \neq 1$ (where $e$ is the reduced Tate pairing). Such $R$ exists by
non-degeneracy. In practice, $R$ is chosen as a random point in $E(\mathbb{F}_{p^k})[\ell]$
and the condition $e(G, R) \neq 1$ is verified.

**Step 2: Compute the pairing values.** Compute

$$g_0 = e(G, R) \in \mu_\ell \subset \mathbb{F}_{p^k}^*, \qquad
h_0 = e(Q, R) \in \mu_\ell \subset \mathbb{F}_{p^k}^*.$$

**Step 3: Apply bilinearity.** By bilinearity of the pairing:

$$h_0 = e(Q, R) = e(k \cdot G, R) = e(G, R)^k = g_0^k.$$

Therefore $k = \log_{g_0}(h_0)$ in $\mathbb{F}_{p^k}^*$.

**Step 4: Solve the DLP in $\mathbb{F}_{p^k}^*$.** The DLP $h_0 = g_0^k$ in $\mathbb{F}_{p^k}^*$
is solved by NFS-DL (the frozen `gnfs::dl::solve_dl` entry point, Track D). Since $g_0, h_0
\in \mu_\ell \subset \mathbb{F}_{p^k}^*$, the DLP is in the order-$\ell$ subgroup of
$\mathbb{F}_{p^k}^*$.

**Step 5: Recover $k$.** The NFS-DL solver returns $k \bmod \ell$, which is the ECDLP scalar.

#### Why this is a polynomial-time reduction

The reduction from ECDLP to DLP in $\mathbb{F}_{p^k}^*$ is polynomial-time:

1. **Finding $R$:** a random point in $E(\mathbb{F}_{p^k})[\ell]$ can be found in $O(\mathrm{poly}(k
   \log p))$ time by computing $(\#E(\mathbb{F}_{p^k}) / \ell) \cdot P$ for a random $P$.
2. **Computing the pairing:** Miller's algorithm costs $O(k \log p)$ field operations in
   $\mathbb{F}_{p^k}$.
3. **The final exponentiation:** costs $O(k \log p)$ field operations.

The total reduction cost is $O(\mathrm{poly}(k \log p))$ — polynomial in $k \log p$. For small
$k$ (the MOV threshold), this is efficient.

#### The embedding-degree condition (the MOV threshold)

The MOV reduction is effective only when $k$ is small. For a generic elliptic curve over
$\mathbb{F}_p$, the embedding degree $k$ is $\Theta(p)$ — exponentially large — and the
reduction is useless (the DLP in $\mathbb{F}_{p^k}^*$ is harder than the original ECDLP).

The *MOV threshold* is the condition $k \leq C \log p$ for a small constant $C$. Curves with
small embedding degree are called *MOV-vulnerable*. For a random curve over $\mathbb{F}_p$,
the probability that $k \leq C \log p$ is negligibly small (roughly $1/p$), so most curves
are not MOV-vulnerable. Cryptographic curves are specifically chosen to have large embedding
degree (e.g. secp256k1 has $k \approx 2^{128}$).

#### L-notation

The MOV reduction reduces the ECDLP to a DLP in $\mathbb{F}_{p^k}^*$. The DLP in
$\mathbb{F}_{p^k}^*$ is solved by NFS-DL in time $L_{p^k}[1/3, (64/9)^{1/3}]$ (§9 of this
textbook). For small $k$, $p^k$ is polynomial in $p$, so:

$$\text{MOV-reduced ECDLP complexity} = L_{p^k}\!\left[\tfrac{1}{3},\, \left(\tfrac{64}{9}\right)^{1/3}\right]
= L_p\!\left[\tfrac{1}{3},\, k^{1/3} \cdot \left(\tfrac{64}{9}\right)^{1/3}\right].$$

This is subexponential in $\log p$ — a dramatic improvement over rho's $L_p[1, 1/2]$ (fully
exponential). The cross-track bridge: the MOV reduction connects the ECDLP (Track E) to the
NFS-DL setting (Track D), where the $L[1/3]$ complexity applies.

**Principle-4 annotation.** At toy scale ($p = 47$, $k = 2$, $\ell = 3$), the pairing + NFS-DL
overhead dominates the toy rho cost. The asymptotic win requires crypto-scale $p$ where the
$L[1/3]$ vs $L[1, 1/2]$ separation is observable.

### §10.6 Per-Attack L-Notation Comparison

This table extends the frozen §"Escape from Search" L-notation hierarchy table with a per-attack
row for the five algebraic ECDLP attacks. The baseline is Pollard rho.

| Attack | Escape structure | L-notation complexity | Precondition | Toy-scale observable? |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| Pollard rho (baseline) | None — generic $\sqrt{n}$ walk | $L_n[1, 1/2] = \Theta(\sqrt{n})$ | None | Yes (the baseline) |
| Pohlig–Hellman | Composite group order | $L_{p_{\max}}[1, 1/2]$ (largest prime factor) | $n$ composite with small $p_{\max}$ | No — speedup requires $p_{\max} \ll n$ |
| Smart–Satoh–Araki | Anomalous order ($\#E = p$) | $L_p[0] = O(\log p)$ (polynomial time) | $\#E(\mathbb{F}_p) = p$ | Mechanism yes; timing separation no |
| GHS/Weil descent | Binary field tower | Conditional: $L_{p^{m/l}}[1/2, c]$ (downstream index calculus on Jacobian) | $E/\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$, $l \mid m$, $m/l$ odd | No — transfer only at toy scale |
| Index calculus | Factor-base decomposability | $L_{p^n}[1/2, c]$ (subexponential, $n > 1$) | $E(\mathbb{F}_{p^n})$, $n > 1$ | No — toy fixture is $n = 1$ |
| MOV/Frey–Rück | Small embedding degree | $L_{p^k}[1/3, (64/9)^{1/3}]$ (via NFS-DL) | $\ell \mid p^k - 1$, $k$ small | No — pairing overhead dominates at toy scale |

**The principle-4 boundary, stated explicitly.** The asymptotic L-notation separations in this
table are NOT observable at the toy scale of the C-EWBench fixtures ($p = 47$, $p = 7$). The
table reports the theoretical complexity class; the toy-scale costs are in `docs/BENCHMARKS.md`
§E.W. The separation between $L[1, 1/2]$ (rho), $L[1/2]$ (index calculus), $L[1/3]$ (MOV via
NFS-DL), and $L[0]$ (SSA) is a statement about asymptotic behaviour at cryptographic scale —
not a ranking of the toy-scale timings.
