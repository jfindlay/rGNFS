//! Known-answer tests (KATs) for the special-q sieve.
//!
//! Three KATs:
//!
//! (a) Relations collected per-``q`` all satisfy ``verify()`` and carry ``q`` in the
//!     algebraic exponent vector.
//!
//! (b) The per-``q`` yield (relations per sieve area) is at least as good as a naive sieve
//!     of the same area — or annotated as under-exposed at toy scale per ROADMAP principle 4.
//!
//! (c) The output is deterministic for a fixed ``q``-range + parameters.
//!
//! # Polynomial used throughout
//!
//! ``f(x) = x³ − x − 1`` (coefficients: [−1, −1, 0, 1] least-significant first).
//! ``m = 2``, ``n = 5`` (toy scale: ``f(2) = 8 − 2 − 1 = 5``).
//!
//! # Special-q range
//!
//! We use ``q_min = 5``, ``q_max = 17`` for the main KATs. These primes are in the algebraic
//! factor base for ``B_alg = 30``:
//!
//! - ``q = 5``: root ``r = 2`` (``f(2) = 5 ≡ 0 mod 5``).
//! - ``q = 7``: root ``r = 5`` (``f(5) = 119 = 7×17 ≡ 0 mod 7``).
//! - ``q = 17``: root ``r = 5`` (``f(5) = 119 = 7×17 ≡ 0 mod 17``).
//!
//! # Principle-4 annotation (yield comparison)
//!
//! At toy scale (small ``A``, ``B``, ``q``), the yield advantage of the special-q strategy
//! over the plain line sieve is under-exposed. The yield multiplier is a scale phenomenon:
//! at cryptographic scale, the special-q strategy is the dominant sieving technique because
//! the algebraic norm ``N_alg(a, b)`` is large and the probability of smoothness is low
//! without the pre-guaranteed factor ``q``. At toy scale, the norms are already small and
//! smooth, so the advantage is marginal. KAT (b) annotates this explicitly and checks the
//! structural property (``q`` in the algebraic exponent vector) rather than asserting a
//! yield improvement that is not observable at toy scale.
