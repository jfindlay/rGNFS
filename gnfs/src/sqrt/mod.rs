//! Square root stage for GNFS: rational and algebraic square roots, and final assembly.
//!
//! This module is the entry point for the `gnfs::sqrt` sub-crate. It provides:
//!
//! - [`rational`] — rational square root: given a `KernelVector`, recover the relation index
//!   set S via `expand_provenance`, form the product ∏(a − bm) over ℤ, extract its integer
//!   square root X via `isqrt`, and reduce X mod N. Entry point: [`rational::rational_sqrt`].
//! - [`algebraic`] — algebraic square root via Couveignes' CRT algorithm in ℤ[α].
//!   Entry point: [`algebraic::algebraic_sqrt`].
//! - [`assembly`] — final assembly: combine X and Y, compute gcd(X − Y, N) to extract a
//!   non-trivial factor. Entry points: [`assembly::factor_from_congruence`], [`assembly::factor`].
//!
//! # Background
//!
//! The square root stage is the terminal stage of the GNFS factoring pipeline. A `KernelVector`
//! from the linear algebra step encodes a subset S of relations whose combined rational
//! and algebraic norms are each perfect squares. This module recovers the original (a, b) pairs
//! through the filtering provenance map and computes:
//!
//! 1. **Rational square root X**: X² ≡ ∏_{i ∈ S}(a_i − b_i·m) (mod N).
//! 2. **Algebraic square root Y**: Y = |Norm(β)| mod N where β² = ∏_{i ∈ S}(a_i − b_i·α).
//! 3. **Assembly**: gcd(X − Y, N) is a non-trivial factor of N when X ≢ ±Y (mod N).
//!
//! # Linear algebra → square root seam
//!
//! `KernelVector::expand_provenance` is the linear algebra → square root seam, over-specified
//! at the linear algebra substrate precisely for this consumer. The rational square root step
//! is its first real client.
