//! Born-rule measurement: sample a basis state with probability |aᵢ|², collapse the register.
//!
//! # Measurement model
//!
//! Quantum measurement in the computational basis samples a basis state `k` with probability
//! `|aₖ|²` (the Born rule). After measurement, the register collapses: the measured basis state
//! gets amplitude 1, all others get amplitude 0.
//!
//! # Deterministic seeded sampler
//!
//! The sampler uses `rand_chacha::ChaCha8Rng` seeded with a `u64` seed. This makes KATs
//! reproducible: the same seed + same state always produces the same measurement outcome.
//! For non-test code, use a random seed from `rand::thread_rng()` or an OS source.
//!
//! # Single-qubit vs full-register measurement
//!
//! - [`measure_all`]: sample a full basis state, collapse the entire register.
//! - [`measure_qubit`]: measure a single qubit, collapse only that qubit's degree of freedom
//!   (the remaining qubits are renormalized conditioned on the measured outcome).
