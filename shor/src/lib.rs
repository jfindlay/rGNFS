//! Classical state-vector quantum-circuit simulator: the substrate for Shor's algorithm.
//!
//! # Structure
//!
//! - [`statevec`] — dense `Vec<Complex<f64>>` register over n qubits, little-endian basis
//!   indexing (qubit 0 = LSB). Constructors, normalization invariant, ~25-qubit resource ceiling.
//! - [`gates`] — universal gate set applied by amplitude-pair iteration (O(2^n) per gate, never
//!   matrix materialization): single-qubit X, Y, Z, H, S, T, phase(θ), arbitrary unitary;
//!   two-qubit CNOT, controlled-phase, SWAP; multi-qubit Toffoli, multi-controlled.
//! - [`sparse`] — sparse-state register: a `HashMap` of nonzero basis amplitudes. Same gate
//!   semantics as the dense register, iterating only nonzero entries. Dense↔sparse conversion.
//!   Sparsity is state-dependent (principle 4): a Hadamard on every qubit makes the state dense.
//! - [`measure`] — Born-rule measurement: sample a basis state with probability |aᵢ|², collapse
//!   the register. Single-qubit and full-register measurement. Deterministic seeded sampler
//!   (`rand_chacha::ChaCha8Rng`) for reproducible KATs.
//! - [`qft`] — Quantum Fourier Transform over the dense register: Hadamard + controlled-phase
//!   ladder (O(n²) gates), built from the gate set in [`gates`]. Inverse QFT. Bit-reversal
//!   convention documented and included (see [`qft`] module for the load-bearing note).
//! - [`arith`] — Reversible modular-arithmetic quantum circuit builders (C-ModExp):
//!   controlled-add-mod (`|x⟩ → |x + c mod N⟩`), controlled-mult-mod (`|x⟩ → |c·x mod N⟩`),
//!   and controlled modular-exponentiation (`|x⟩|y⟩ → |x⟩|y·aˣ mod N⟩`). Assembled from the
//!   gate set in [`gates`]; no new gate added to the simulator. Every ancilla is returned to |0⟩
//!   (ancilla-clean invariant). Register layout: exponent qubits `[0, t)`, work qubits `[t, t+n)`,
//!   where `N < 2^n` and `t` is the exponent register size. See [`arith::ModExpLayout`] for the
//!   C-ModExp interface consumed by the order-finding circuit.
//! - [`curve`] — Toy short-Weierstrass elliptic curve `y² = x³ + 3 mod 7` (C-PointAdd):
//!   plain `u64` affine group law (add, double, negate, scalar-mul), generator `G = (1,2)`,
//!   prime order `r = 13`. The classical reference for the point-addition circuit's KATs. See
//!   [`curve::PointAddLayout`] for the register-layout map.
//! - [`ecc`] — Reversible controlled point-addition quantum circuit (C-PointAdd):
//!   `|P⟩ → |P + cG⟩` for a classically-fixed point `cG`, controlled on a qubit. Assembled from
//!   the gate set in [`gates`] + the permutation-synthesis primitive in [`arith`]; no new gate
//!   added. Every scratch register returns to |0⟩ (ancilla-clean invariant). Consumed by the
//!   two-register ECDLP period-finding circuit in [`ecdlp`].
//! - [`shor`] — Order-finding circuit orchestration, continued-fraction period extraction, and
//!   `factor(N)` driver (C-OrderFind + C-Factor). Consumes C-ModExp and the QFT/measure surfaces.
//!   Implements the complete Shor-factoring algorithm: exponent-register superposition →
//!   controlled-mod-exp → iQFT → measure → continued-fraction recovery of the order `r` →
//!   even-order factor extraction via `gcd(a^(r/2) ± 1, N)`.
//!   Factors 15 → {3,5}, 21 → {3,7}, 35 → {5,7}, 91 → {7,13} (the canonical toy targets).
//! - [`ecdlp`] — Two-register ECDLP period-finding, 2D-lattice discrete-log extraction, and
//!   `solve_ecdlp` driver (C-ECDLPSolve). Consumes C-PointAdd (controlled point-addition circuit)
//!   and the QFT/measure surfaces. Implements Shor's ECDLP algorithm: two-register superposition
//!   → controlled-point-add (a·G + b·Q) → iQFT on both registers → measure → 2D-lattice
//!   extraction `b'·k ≡ −a' (mod r)` → verify `k·G = Q`. Solves the ECDLP on the toy curve
//!   (r=13, 17 qubits, within the ~25-qubit ceiling).
//!
//! # Basis-indexing convention (FIXED — C-StateVec)
//!
//! **Little-endian:** qubit 0 is the least-significant bit of the basis index. For an n-qubit
//! register the basis state |q_{n-1} … q_1 q_0⟩ maps to index
//! `i = q_0 + 2·q_1 + 4·q_2 + … + 2^{n-1}·q_{n-1}`.
//!
//! This convention is fixed in [`statevec`] and consumed by the QFT ([`qft`]), modular
//! exponentiation ([`arith`]), and Proos–Zalka ECDLP circuit ([`ecdlp`]). A silent flip is a
//! wrong-answer bug.
//!
//! # QFT bit-reversal convention (FIXED — C-QFT)
//!
//! The standard QFT circuit (N&C) is designed for big-endian. [`qft::qft`] adapts it for
//! little-endian with **two bit-reversal steps** (input + output), so the output is in natural
//! little-endian order. Without both steps, the order-finding and ECDLP circuits read the period
//! from the wrong qubit order.
//! See [`qft`] module documentation for the full load-bearing note.
//!
//! # Resource-scale ceiling (~25 qubits)
//!
//! The dense register holds `2^n` complex amplitudes. At n = 25 that is 2^25 ≈ 33 M entries
//! (≈ 512 MiB of f64 pairs). This is a **resource-scale wall** (principle 4): the mathematics
//! is identical at 25 or 250 qubits; only the exponential array makes 250 unreachable on a
//! laptop. The simulator demonstrates Shor's mathematics correctly at toy scale; it does not
//! claim quantum speedup, which requires real quantum hardware out of scope by construction.
