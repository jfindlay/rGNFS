//! GF(2^m) polynomial-basis arithmetic, generic over the limb count.
//!
//! This crate exposes the [`F2m`] trait and one concrete implementation:
//! [`F2mNaive`] (schoolbook carryless-multiply + modular reduction).
//!
//! # Design: const-generic-on-trait approach
//!
//! The trait is parameterised as `F2m<const L: usize>` where `L` is the
//! number of 64-bit limbs in the underlying `Uint<L>`.  This mirrors `Fp<L>`
//! exactly and avoids the nightly-only `generic_const_exprs` feature that
//! would be required by an explicit degree const (see `shared/field/src/lib.rs`
//! lines 7–18 for the same design note).  The degree `m` is a *runtime*
//! property recovered from the irreducible as `m = poly.bits() − 1`.
//!
//! # Storage: `Uint<L>` as a polynomial coefficient bit-vector
//!
//! **CRITICAL:** `Uint<L>` is used here as a *polynomial coefficient
//! bit-vector*, NOT as an integer.  Bit `i` of the stored value represents the
//! coefficient of `x^i` in the polynomial.  Only XOR, shift, and bit
//! operations are meaningful on these values.  The integer-arithmetic methods
//! on `Uint<L>` (`wrapping_add`, `rem`, `mul_wide`, etc.) are meaningless on
//! GF(2) coefficient vectors and MUST NOT be used for field arithmetic.  In
//! particular, `mul_wide` performs integer multiplication with carry — the
//! carryless multiply in `mul`/`square` uses the comb algorithm (shift-and-XOR)
//! instead.
//!
//! # Irreducible polynomial
//!
//! Every operation that depends on the field's identity takes `poly: &Uint<L>`
//! as a parameter, mirroring `Fp`'s per-call `p: &Uint<L>`.  The irreducible
//! is the bit-vector of the degree-`m` reduction polynomial: bit `i` set ⟺
//! coefficient of `x^i` is 1.  Examples:
//! - GF(2^4) with `x⁴+x+1`:           `poly = 0b1_0011`  (= 0x13)
//! - GF(2^8) AES with `x⁸+x⁴+x³+x+1`: `poly = 0b1_0001_1011` (= 0x11b)
//!
//! Operations mixing elements reduced under *different* irreducibles are
//! meaningless — the caller is responsible for consistency (analogous to the
//! C-MovBridge modulus-consistency guard in `shared/field`).
//!
//! # Characteristic-2 invariants
//!
//! - **`sub == add`**: subtraction in GF(2^m) is XOR, identical to addition.
//!   Do NOT port `Fp`'s `sub` (which computes `p − self`).
//! - **`neg == identity`**: negation in characteristic 2 is the identity map
//!   (`−a = a`).  Do NOT port `Fp`'s `neg` (which computes `p − self`).
//!
//! # Toy field sizes
//!
//! The KATs use GF(2^4) and GF(2^8).  The algorithms are not toy — they are
//! the same algorithms used for crypto-scale `m` (163, 233, 571) — but the
//! parameters are small for auditability (principle-4 boundary).
